    "abstract": "Nalini Jameela (1954–) is a sex worker and activist from Kerala. She is also an autobiographer. Sex workers are treated as the other of ideal Indian womanhood. In regular parlance, the other is known by the term ‘veshya’ (prostitute). Jameela willfully embraces the cultural other.\n\nWe give details of Jameela’s feminist sex pedagogy, especially of an itinerant kind. Jameela knows for a fact that her male clients always see her as a veshya figure. Their transferences on her are based on the cultural imagination of the veshya. Also, due to constant battering her mirror of the body is not totally predictable and speckle-free. In fact, it remains broken.\n\nVia transferences, Jameela’s male clients open up to her. In the process, they learn a good deal about sex, intimacy, and mutuality of pleasure. She offers an alternative worldview about sex to her male clients who are by and large driven by stereotypes and taboo concerning heterosexual intimacy.\n\nIn psychoanalysis, mirroring or transference signifies non-judgmental listening on the part of the therapist who also reflects back psychological projections of the patients. Although Jameela is not a trained psychotherapist, she deploys them unwittingly. Eventually, she rehabilitates ill-conceived cultural notions concerning the veshya figure."

    "abstract": "Globally, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in several psychosocial manifestations across all socioeconomic strata. This study attempted to explore the details of a psychosocial support system implemented in Kerala, India, to address psychosocial issues during this pandemic. \n\nIt employed a descriptive approach using qualitative and quantitative methods. The results can be summarized into 4 overarching themes: (1) process of implementation, (2) issues addressed, (3) experiences, and (4) success stories. This intervention targeted the whole population, with a specific focus on quarantined/isolated individuals and selected vulnerable groups. COVID pandemic has sowed several negative emotions, such as anxiety; and stigma and fearful thoughts, including suicidal ideations; trepidation regarding family members; and misinfodemics in general. Social and religious corollaries of the pandemic have intensified the psychological agony. \n\nThe study provides an overview of the psychosocial intervention adopted by the state during the pandemic, which has helped both the beneficiaries and the providers. It has also helped to promote positive thinking and change the attitude toward the disease among the beneficiaries. It is highly commendable that timely intervention could obviate quite a few psychiatric emergencies, including suicides and aggressive behaviors. Considering its efficiency, flexibility, and sustainability, this model can be replicated in any setting."

    "abstract": "Caste and caste inequalities are existing as a factual reality in the present day too. In Kerala, irrespective of high development, literacy and secularism, caste is still a crucial matter in the social and cultural life of the people. Related to the caste system in the Hindu religion is hierarchy in status, prevailing inequalities in power and wealth as well as imbalances in the religious sphere. This study explores such a case in which the famous religious ritual of kaliyattam in Northern Kerala is subjected to an ethnographic investigation. What resulted is the understanding of the harsh realities existing in the society in terms of caste and ritual authorities and exploitation. The different communities in the region that are a part of the ritual have to follow strict customs, which are mostly exploitative economically and unjustifiable and inhumane socially."

    "abstract": "Iron Age–Early Historic culture in the southern part of Peninsular India is associated with early iron-using society in the region and is renowned for its burial architecture, ritual offerings, ceramics, iron implements, and other material culture. The modern state of Kerala, while sharing the salient features of this Iron Age-Early Historic culture, exhibits unique types of laterite-made Megalithic burial architecture due to its geographic and physiographic peculiarities.\n\nThis paper reports the findings from an excavation conducted in 2019 at Enadimangalam [Pathanamthitta District] in Kerala and its implications for understanding cist burial architecture and burial practices. The excavated cist burial displays the features of a double-chambered cist with cot/bench made of stone slabs.\n\nBased on the evidence, the process of the construction of a cist burial is elucidated, and the possible indications of later modification are highlighted. Possibilities of the multiple uses of the same burial structure during the Iron Age–Early Historic period is suggested.\n\nThe scattered distribution of burial structures in the region of Enadimangalam reflects the presence of smaller settlements and supports the possible multiple uses of the same burial. The importance of considering the landscape and its peculiarities in the further search for habitation evidence is highlighted, particularly in the context of a dearth of habitation evidence connected to Megalithic burials in Kerala."

    "abstract": "(edited) Although Kerala has remarkable outcomes in many social-economic development indicators, its road safety position is not impressive. Recent reports about road accidents in India indicate that Kerala came second among different states. Road traffic accident (RTA) is considered the third major cause of death in the state.\n\nThe present study focuses on analysing the number of persons killed due to RTA in Kerala over 2005–2018 at different time zones of a day. Freely available secondary data released by the Kerala Police was used for the analysis. The analysis confirms seasonality and an upward trend in the RTA deaths in Kerala during 2005–2018.\n\nThe minimum number of RTA deaths happened from 00.00 a.m. to 3.00 a.m. and the maximum number of deaths occurred from 18.00 p.m. to 21.00 p.m. RTA deaths in Kerala during evening and night-time were relatively higher than other time zones.\n\nSince 2016, there is a steady increase in RTA deaths in the time zone 21.00 p.m.–24.00 p.m. The predicted RTA deaths during 2019–2021 also exhibited an upward trend.\n\nFor a better picture, we must investigate the relationship between the number of persons killed in different time zones and corresponding risk factors, such as driver's behaviour, vehicle features, road-traffic characteristics and geographic and environmental influences. Governments must develop and maintain a comprehensive, updated database on road traffic accident details."

The non-medical interventions of social distancing, quarantine and lockdown have been adopted to prevent transmission of the disease by contact. In some countries, police have been used to enforce public health laws. This research analyses data from two districts in the State of Kerala, India to examine whether police efforts had any impact on the outcome of reducing transmission of the disease by contact. Analysing the different methods used by the police across the two districts, this study concludes that police efforts at non-medical interventions reduce the spread of the disease. The study also concludes that, in contrast to mere enforcement of public health laws and regulations, the strategic use of resources is an important factor in achieving better outcomes."

    "abstract": "The Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) features small-scale and developing country fisheries prominently in promoting its sustainability programme, yet the problem of low levels of certification in developing country fisheries is a long-standing and important issue in marine policy.\n\nThe objective of this paper is to better understand small-scale, developing country fishery experiences with the oldest fisheries certification programme globally. It does so primarily through a comparative case study of fisheries that were among the first in their wider regions to engage the programme. The paper assesses fisheries in Kerala and The Gambia (West Africa), detailing the evolution of engagement with MSC sustainability certification.\n\nAnalytically, the paper assesses experiences, successes, and frustrations in these cases across ecological, economic, social, and institutional dimensions—categories that have gained widespread appeal in sustainability studies.\n\nThe paper finds that what makes a fishery certifiable or uncertifiable is not just levels of performance against the sustainability certification standard but also a broader range of relations and interactions that influence paths of development and change in fisheries. We, therefore, call for more explicitly integrated and critical explanatory social science and interdisciplinary evaluations of fisheries certifiability, broadly understood as impacted by diverse ecological, social, economic and political factors and relationships. Technical certifiability, social-ecological certifiability, and uncertifiability will be introduced to broaden our understanding."

We know relatively little about the CF practices of tribal mothers in the context of the high rate of poor health and undernutrition in tribal children of Kerala. This study, therefore, examined the factors influencing CF practices in tribal infants and young children.\n\nWe conducted a community based cross-sectional survey of 1,150 tribal mother-infant pairs from five districts. We used a pre-tested interview schedule for data collection. Alongside descriptive statistics, we used multiple linear regression for data analyses.\n\nAround 76.2% continued breastfeeding at the 6th month, 62.7% introduced CF at the 6th month, 22.7% of children received low or potentially harmful CF, 48.4% children received harmful CF, and merely 8.6% received optimal CF.\n\nMaternal education, marital status, age at first pregnancy optimised CF and occupational status, hours of work per day, work status before pregnancy, and age at marriage were inversely associated with 40% of the variance.\n\nTribal mothers’ perceived difficulty for breastfeeding in public space increased CF scores and mothers who initiated CF early were more likely to feed children less-optimal.\n\nTribal mothers practise predominantly poor and potentially harmful CF to young children aged 6–24 months."

Both films situate the lovers in a regional milieu which challenges notions of progress, as representations of political and religious contest suggest. Taking Ratheesh Radhakrishnan’s claim that the Malayalam film prioritises Keraliyatha or ‘Kerala-ness’, I suggest that songs and rituals are crucial to the films’ imagining of the lovers in relation to local cultures. Annayum Rasoolum and Eeda hold out the prospect of different futures, yet, ultimately, fall back on ambiguated conclusions and spectacles of separation and precarity."

    "abstract": "In this article, I explore how dominant caste Christians in the state of Kerala, India have perpetuated a false narrative of “love jihads” while at the same time have pushed campaigns for dominant caste Christian women to have more children. I focus on the Syro-Malabar Catholics; an Eastern Rite of Catholicism and part of a larger group of Christians called the “Syrian Christians.” The Syrian Christians are, and have historically been, dominant caste and are recognized by the Kerala state and other religious groups as such. Since the literal reproduction of religious and caste hierarchies is only possible through endogamous (arranged) marriages, controlling women’s bodily autonomy and their sexual agency are a function of brahmanical patriarchy, or the intersections of casteism and patriarchy. I thus trace over a decade of incidents where unsubstantiated claims of “love jihads” have been raised by the Syro-Malabar hierarchy, and how these claims are often accompanied by initiatives aimed at encouraging Syro-Malabar Catholic women to have more children. While South Asia studies and feminist studies have examined the invented moral panic of “love jihads” in a Hindu/Muslim frame, it is important to contextualize how and why dominant caste Syro-Malabar priests, bishops, archbishops, and cardinals have also used the charge of “love jihads” to whip up communal panics that are both casteist and Islamophobic at their base."

    "abstract": "Dalit historiography is the narrativisation of the past from a Dalit perspective purposive of critiquing existing traditions of Indian historiographies and/or producing alternate histories. It is the discourse through which historiographical erasures and misrepresentations are challenged through narratives that recover and reinterpret the past from anti-caste standpoints. This counter-discourse reorients historiography and transforms historical understandings by recognising caste as a structuring principle of history. \n\nThis article attempts to theorise Dalit historiography as a resistance epistemology by outlining its methodological and thematic aspects through a study of DCUF cultural productions. DCUF (Depressed Class United Front) is an Adi-Dravida community named Dravida Varga Aikya Munnani that emerged as an anti-caste politico-religious group in 1950s Kerala under the leadership of PJ SabharajThirumeni.\n\nTo understand the politics of the alternate history articulated by DCUF, the article first maps the field of mainstream Kerala historiography to which DCUF cultural productions may be seen as a historiographical response. DCUF cultural productions, as an articulation of Dalit historiography, intervene in the epistemology of this mode of history writing by placing caste as the fulcrum of history by giving an alternate picture of the past vis-à-vis the origins of caste, its manifestations and anti-caste resistance. \n\nThis study foregrounds the political valence of history in Dalit struggle and the ongoing negotiations between Dalit communities with the mainstream vis-à-vis history and history writing."

    "abstract": "With the rise of Hindutva fundamentalism in India, the hegemony of vegetarianism and the resultant othering of subaltern/non-vegetarian food cultures have intensified. Consequently, Dalits, Adivasis and various religious minorities are being subject to physical and symbolic forms of violence on grounds of their dietary habits. While members of these communities, mostly in the Northern states of India, became victims of lynching by cow vigilantes, acts of resistance termed as ‘Beef Festivals’ were organised across Kerala since 2015. Aided by the peculiar socio-political climate of the state, Malayalam films rapidly assimilated the celebratory/fearless spirit of these festivals of resistance. Reassertion of non-vegetarian culinary traditions, specifically those that are deemed transgressive in the national milieu, by placing them in the political context of Hindutva has become a practice in Malayalam films.\n\nBy critically looking at select Malayalam films produced in this period, the paper attempts to study the carnivalesque performances in these films and argues that they construct carnival spaces that subvert the food-based hierarchies prevalent in India."

The levels and distribution of radionuclides in sediments from this coastal area have been determined. The activities ranges and mean (in bracket) values for 238U, 232Th, and 40K are 78.92 to 1493 Bq kg−1 (552.63), 94.76 to 2856.46 (851.24) Bq kg−1 and 30 to 2399.20 (678.61) Bq kg−1 respectively. The mean activity of 238U, 232Th, and 40K are higher than the global average values (35 Bq kg−1 for 238U, 400 Bq kg−1 for 40K, and 30 Bq kg−1 for 232Th) of these radionuclides in the sediment and it may be due the presence of rich deposits of black sands. The radium equivalent activity was estimated to range from 216.74 to 5762.48 Bq kg−1 (1822.17). The average absorbed dose rate was determined to vary from 94.96 to 2515.83 nGyh−1 (797.97) and the annual effective dose was estimated to range from 0.12 to 3.09 mSvy−1 (0.98). Additionally, it was estimated that the average external hazard index was 4.92 and the average internal hazard index was 6.41 respectively. The computed radiation indices for all samples were compared to internationally accepted standards, showing that they are above the recommended limits. The results of the present investigation indicate that the radioactivity in the region is slightly above the global average values."

    "abstract": "My paper explores the dynamics of twentieth-century literary manifestations of communist internationalism in the southern Indian region of Kerala vis-a-vis the Soviet Union. Drawing from Allan Pasco's notion of the literature-archive, I illustrate how communist internationalism in Kerala was expressed in terms of worldmaking in three chronological periods in response to political and literary shifts at the local, national and global levels. The first period deals with early engagements of the literature-archive from the 1910s till the 1930s, marked by a yearning for an amorphously defined new world characterised by individualised political canonical engagements with individuals associated with Marxism as well as situational identification with the worlds of Tsarist Russia and Soviet Union. The prominence of the progressive literature movement from the late-1930s until the late 1940s resulted in the emergence of multiple literary-political circles that wrought various imaginations of a socialist realist egalitarian internationalist world, producing and contesting various visions of Soviet Union. Finally, in the third period, I deal with how the Cold War context enabled the perpetuation of these literary contestations as well as the diffusion of a new mode of the cultural internationalism of the post-Stalinist Soviet Union from the 1950s till the 1980s making and contesting Soviet utopias in travelogs and children's literature."

    "abstract": "Indian studies have highlighted medical students’ negative attitudes toward LGBTQIA+ individuals and a lack of LGBTQIA+-informed training. However, no study has assessed the LGBTQIA+-cultural competency of Indian psychiatrists. This cross-sectional study assessed the cultural competency of psychiatrists in Kerala, an Indian state, and explored its association with relevant sociodemographic and experiential variables. LGBTQIA+ cultural competency was measured using the LGBT Development of Clinical Skills Scale (LGBT-DOCSS). Data were collected through stratified convenience sampling, in-person at psychiatry meetings and online through WhatsApp. Participants (N = 166) had a moderate overall LGBT-DOCSS score (mean ± SD: 5.03 ± 0.80). Subscales showed moderate knowledge (median: 5.50, IQR: 2), high attitudinal awareness (median: 6.14, IQR: 1), and low clinical preparedness (3.88 ± 1.43). LGB (5.16 ± 0.83) and transgender (5.02 ± 0.85) cultural competencies were moderate. Most participants (n = 160, 96.4%) treated < 5 LGBTQIA+ patients per month, and only 16 (9.6%) had received LGBTQIA+-informed training. Age (ρ = -0.18, p = 0.018) and religiosity (ρ = -0.23, p = 0.002) were significantly negatively correlated with cultural competency. Psychiatrists who treated < 5 LGBTQIA+ patients per month demonstrated significantly lesser cultural competency than those who treated 5–10 (t = -2.78, p = 0.033). Psychiatrists in Kerala have moderate LGBTQIA+ cultural competency, with high attitudinal awareness, moderate knowledge, and low clinical preparedness. This study highlights the need for comprehensive cultural competency training."

    "abstract": "This study investigates the sediment transportation and deposition in the Kollam shoreline, Southwest coast of Kerala, India. For this study forty-five (S1–S15) surface sediment samples were collected from five beaches in three different seasons. Results of sediment samples across three different seasons reveal significant temporal shifts in mean grain size (medium to coarse sand), sorting (poorly sorted sediments in monsoon), skewness (coarse to fine-skewed), and kurtosis (leptokurtic to platykurtic). Medium sand dominated sites S3, S4, S5, S6, S7, S11, and S13 throughout all seasons, while monsoon-driven hydrodynamic energy resulted in poor sorting and coarse sand deposition in S1 and S15. Skewness transitions highlighted fluctuating wave and riverine influences, with leptokurtic patterns were most prevalent in the pre-monsoon and post monsoon season, while mesokurtic patterns dominated in monsoon season. Linear Discriminant Function (LDF) analysis delineated depositional environments, indicating beach (100% in Y1) and shallow marine dominance (80% in Y2, 100% in Y3), with minor fluvial input during monsoon. Stewart and CM plots documented wave action as the primary sediment transport mechanism of graded suspension and rolling under high-energy monsoonal conditions. However fluvial processes were responsible for the deposits in S1 (Berm) and S15 (low tide line) during the monsoon."

Based on field information, this study argues that the interplay of socio-political history, the symbiotic relationship between the church and the INC, social values associated with Syrian Christians, and the antagonism towards the Communists have created ideological subjects aligned with the INC. The residual nature of the INC’s social base or distributive factors, such as patronage, which define the party’s support in other areas, has limited significance here. These ideological underpinnings have sustained the INC’s social base in the region, even as the party faces setbacks elsewhere in India."

This research is based on the JD-R theory.,This study used a cross-sectional research design wherein both descriptive and explanatory approaches were used. This study uses a survey method and a structured questionnaire to collect data from IT women employees in Kerala. A regression analysis is used to measure the direct effects of the hypothesised relationships. Sobel’s test was used to measure the indirect effects of the hypothesised relationship.,Organisational support is found to foster work–life balance and work engagement. Work–life balance fully mediates the relationship between organisational support and work engagement.,This study attempts to integrate two streams of research (work–life balance and work engagement), which, despite being similar in focus, have been developed independently. This is one of the first studies to incorporate access to, utilisation and perceived future use of these practices in a single study. It also adds to the literature by investigating antecedents of work engagement and analysing it as a mediator between organisational support and work engagement, which has been highlighted as a gap in the literature."

    "abstract": "Abstract This essay analyses the often overlooked influence of Jesuit missionaries on Malayalam literary culture and language during the early modern period. Close examination of an unidentified text, the Paravur Dialogues—the earliest known interreligious dialogue written in Garshuni Malayalam—from the last quarter of the sixteenth century, presents a different perspective on its authorship and dating. Despite the prevailing Syro-Malabar attribution of its authorship to Bishop Mar Joseph Kariattil in the eighteenth century, I posit that the probable author of the earliest literary prose work in the Malayalam language was the Catalan Jesuit Francisco Roz, S.J., the first European Archbishop of Angamaly-Cranganore. The religio-linguistic culture embedded in the Malayalam language, the emphasis on religious encounters, and the rich cultural tapestry of early modern Kerala collectively underscore Roz, who played an important role in promoting and adapting Catholicism to the native Christian practices and liturgy of the St Thomas Christians, as the creator of the Paravur Dialogues."

This study evaluates the Indian state of Kerala’s public health emergency (PHE) response plan (titled MPNOK) to the outbreak of Nipah in 2021, using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation for Health Systems (AGREE-HS) tool. The evaluation aims to assess the quality and trustworthiness of the guidelines and provide lessons learned for the future. The MPNOK was assessed using the AGREE-HS tool, which rates the quality of health system guidelines across five domains: topic, participants, methods, recommendations, and implementability. The evaluation followed an established approach for document analysis, involving a thorough review and analysis of the content. Each criterion within the AGREE-HS tool was scored on a 7-point scale, and then a final score was calculated. The MPNOK received an overall quality score of 50%, indicating moderate quality. The guidelines were strong in problem description, prioritisation, expert involvement, and effectiveness of interventions but showed weaknesses in clarity, ethical considerations, updates, and specific critical aspects of the outbreak response. Ambiguities and inconsistencies were also identified in certain areas. This evaluation of the MPNOK highlights the importance of comprehensive, clear, and regularly updated public health guidelines. The study underscores the need for a holistic approach in guideline development, balancing problem identification, evidence-based recommendations, and practical implementability. The findings offer valuable insights for policymakers and public health officials in refining guidelines for future PHEs, especially Nipah."

The company maintained a shipyard in the Dutch capital of Cochin (present-day Kochi). This article examines the use of local forest products for shipbuilding and as export products, with a special focus on shipbuilding timbers. The presence of teak in the forests of the Western Ghats had long been a major asset for Cochin as a shipbuilding centre. The Dutch Company tried to use these and other timber resources for its own needs but was reliant upon local suppliers and networks to connect its coastal shipyard to the inland forests where the trees grew. By the late eighteenth century, teak had also become an export product, especially being taken to Muscat on local vessels."

    "abstract": "Kerala has long resisted the ambitions of the Bharatiya Janata Party in India; a state where despite a large grassroots presence of the Sangh Parivar, the BJP has enjoyed little electoral success. Previous scholarship has attributed this to the peculiar demography in Kerala which makes it difficult to consolidate Hindu sentiment, or to a ‘secular political culture’ nurtured by the socio-religious reform movements and the strong presence of communism. In recent years, the BJP in Kerala has tried to remedy this through outreach to Christian communities to position them as allies against a common ‘Muslim other’. This article looks at Hindu–Christian encounters from the nineteenth century to the present to argue that these attempts can be read productively as rhetorical and strategic. Through an analysis of key incidents, I argue that historically, advocates of Hindutva forces have considered Kerala to possess a ‘sacred geography’ for Hindus, where other identities are seen as invasive."

    "abstract": "In the contemporary education system, the healthy development of children is a pivotal objective. As a result, the social well-being of children became a significant component of classroom management. The aim of the study was to explore how primary school teachers in central Kerala comprehend social well-being while managing child learners. This was strategically carried out by examining embedded conceptions about social well-being in descriptions of student management by teachers.,The data utilised in the current paper were obtained through in-depth interviews with teachers employed in government primary schools in central Kerala, India. The refined data were then subjected to manual thematic analysis.,Four distinct themes were identified from the data. It included social well-being as absence of disruptions, social well-being as quality relationships, social well-being as classroom belongingness and social well-being as active classroom engagement. The study asserts that teachers' conceptions were more focused on creating a well-balanced social atmosphere in the classroom, which can improve the sense of well-being among all, rather than the social well-being of individual child learners with respect to their social context.,The knowledge generated by the present study is noteworthy since it deals with the comprehension of teachers regarding social well-being in managing child learners. Further, the study delves into areas such as conceptions regarding social well-being (how), the components of social well-being teachers focus on for management practices (what) and the reasons for selecting the particular focus domains (why)."

The TSC over the period has been able to improve human health and sanitation coverage in the country. The initial success could be attributed to ‘Nirmal Gram Puraskar’. The total sanitation campaign has effectively made use of the village social structures in Kerala to solve the first generation sanitation issues. Disparities could also be seen. As the TSC is on the verge of a positive transformation to a new and broader perspective, and as the state look forward for a new dimension in sanitation concepts over the next five-year plan, it asks for a review on the coverage patterns. This would support the policy-makers to invest in edifying ideals as the nation progress from the TSC to ‘Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan’. The broad objective of the study thus is to assess the impact of sanitation and hygiene coverage in the state. For measuring the outcomes and relative performance in terms of total sanitation provision, seven selected Gram Panchayats of Kozhikode district are considered. To arrive at a robust scenario, a synthesis of a narrative and statistical model was used. An innovative measurement framework known as ‘Total Sanitation Index’ was developed. The index was formulated for comprehending the relative positions of each Panchayat in terms of total sanitation and the results were presented."

    "abstract": "Potential Fishing Zone (PFZ) advisories exemplify scientific information with direct societal application, particularly for fishing communities. PFZs are identified using satellite-derived Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and chlorophyll (Chl-a), representing productive ocean fronts that are expected to aggregate fish. This study aims to validate the impact of PFZ advisories on daily village fish landings and to investigate environmental conditions driving PFZ formation and their influence on trophic guild structure of catch, a grouping based on the feeding ecology of the species. To achieve this, the daily PFZ advisories issued by the Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS) and daily fish landing data of 117 villages across the state of Kerala, southwest coast of India during 2022–23, were used. Using a lag period approach, which accounts for the delayed responses of the environmental variables on PFZ occurrences, we analysed the effects of remotely-sensed and modelled physical and biogeochemical factors on PFZ formation. Our findings revealed significantly higher fish landings on PFZ days and the immediate next day, validating PFZ advisories over a broad spatial range. Trophic guild analysis showed a shift in dominance of planktivores on PFZ days to carnivores in subsequent days, reflecting productivity transfer through the food web. Lag period analysis indicated that environmental precursors within a two-week window before PFZ formation significantly differed from other days of analysis, identifying optimal lag day for each variable to have maximum influence on the PFZ formation. These findings highlight the need for in-situ experiments and time-series observations at evolving ocean fronts to validate PFZ dynamics and trophic succession. While adoption rates during the study period were unavailable, the higher catches associated with PFZ occurrences affirm the reliability of these advisories. Signs of food web progression and lagged environmental responses also offer valuable insights to refine models to support sustainable marine fisheries forecasts."

    "abstract": "A comprehensive study of the Mundrothruthu (MT) core (70 cm) from the Asthamudi wetland in Kollam, Kerala, India reveals three climate phases during the Little Ice Age (LIA) through multi-proxy investigations. The period (1507–1518 CE) shows high agricultural activity indicated by abundant diatom diversity, significant terrestrial influx, and freshwater runoff. Elevated TOC% and δ13CTOC values suggest high temperature and a warm, humid climate, likely driven by high terrestrial influx and transport of organic matter from the nearby surroundings. This may have increased the organic matter influx to the estuary leading to high TOC% and more negative δ1³C values. The second phase (1519–1548 CE) is characterized by increased marine incursion due to enhanced tidal currents, evidenced by a rise in marine palynomorphs, mixed terrestrial and marine organic matter, less negative δ13C values, and increased mud content. This shift likely reflects changes in sea level or tidal dynamics. The final period (1548–1804 CE) is marked by further enhancement of marine taxa, lower TOC%, and δ13CTOC values, indicating reduced atmospheric CO2 and a temperature decrease of about 1 °C. This period is associated with reduced solar insolation and a southward shift of the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). The study highlights both synchronous and asynchronous climatic behavior on the southwest coast of India relative to global changes during the LIA. Initially warm and humid with high agricultural productivity, the region gradually shifted to marine-dominated conditions due to tidal dynamics and broader climatic shifts. These findings underscore the complex interplay between local and global climatic factors during the LIA."

    "abstract": "A supportive environment can be achieved at the urban or community level when pedestrians navigate their surroundings easily. Every journey begins and concludes with walking; it is crucial to prioritise the infrastructure that enables smooth pedestrian movement. t is necessary to assess current pedestrian facilities and implement enhancements based on uninterrupted pedestrian flow to ensure adequate infrastructure. The methodologies outlined in the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) and the Indian Road Congress (IRC) serve as guidelines for sidewalk assessment. This paper evaluates the relevance of evaluating the sidewalks based on continuous pedestrian movement (CpM) through a live case study in the urban setting of Ernakulam, Kerala, India and undertaking a thorough analysis to identify the drawbacks/shortcomings of the existing methodology in assessing the pedestrian level of service (PLOS) and quality of service (QoS). Our objective is to improve the current evaluation methodology by developing a new approach that addresses the various factors contributing to delays in pedestrian movement, which lead to conflicts on the sidewalk, based on Continuous Pedestrian Movement (CpM). This research highlights the inadequacies of the existing evaluation methodology but also proposes new assessment techniques adapted for any context with all types of delay except for snowfall areas. The study also evaluates the selected streets for the new methodology in understanding pedestrian sidewalks. Experts validated the proposed study methodology. Help the developers and planners efficiently and effectively determine the condition of existing sidewalk facilities to help them improve them if needed for all pedestrian users, especially vulnerable pedestrians."

    "abstract": "Background\nAcoustic Voice Quality Index (AVQI) has emerged in the recent past as a robust multiparametric voice quality evaluation tool. Two versions of AVQI derived using the program PRAAT have found extensive clinical and research applications. These versions have been validated in several languages around the world. However, no research reports are available on validation of AVQI in the South Indian population. Further, studies comparing the performance of the two versions of AVQI are limited in the literature.\nObjectives\nThis study was designed to validate and compare the two versions of AVQI (AVQIv02.02 and AVQIv03.01) in South Indian languages (Malayalam and Kannada).\nMethods\nA retrospective analysis of previously recorded voice samples was carried out on a total of 160 (91 normophonic and 69 dysphonic) voice samples. These samples were perceptually rated on a GRBAS scale by five experienced speech-language pathologists. Standardized Syllable Number (SSN) necessary to derive AVQIv03.01 was computed. Following this, these samples were analyzed to obtain the AVQIv02.02 and AVQIv03.01. The concurrent validity and diagnostic accuracy of these measures were then examined and compared.\nResults\nA moderate agreement was obtained across the judges on perceptual evaluation of voice quality. SSN in Malayalam and Kannada languages were identified to be 29 and 25 syllables respectively. Language differences were not observed on both versions of AVQI. The concurrent validity of AVQIv03.01 (r = 0.788) was superior to that of AVQIv02.02 (r = 0.655). Further, the threshold of differentiating normophonic and dysphonic samples were determined to be >3.45 for AVQIv02.02 and >2.45 for AVQIv03.01.\nConclusions\nAVQIv03.01 is superior to AVQIv02.02 in terms of its diagnostic accuracy and concurrent validity. Current findings also extend the application of AVQI as a robust tool for the evaluation of voice characteristics to the South Indian population."

    "abstract": "Recent changes in global precipitation patterns have led to unparalleled floods, landslides, and droughts, significantly impacting lives, infrastructure, and the environment. Understanding regional-scale climate change impacts on hydrological responses has attracted researchers, primarily using climate projections from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). This study focuses on the southern Western Ghats (SWG) and western coastal plains (WCP) of the Indian subcontinent to assess climate change impacts on regional hydrology. By analyzing climate data from nine CMIP6 General Circulation Models (GCMs) and simulating hydrological fluxes with the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model, we demonstrate that all models robustly project an intensification of the hydrological cycle due to climate warming under two shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) - SSP245 and SSP585 - especially during the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) season. The region is projected to experience up to a 20 % increase in annual precipitation per 1 °C rise in temperature, with extreme precipitation events (EPEs) potentially increasing by up to 16 % per degree of warming. Future runoff is expected to rise under both SSP scenarios, with watersheds experiencing markedly wetter ISM season and drier pre-monsoon (PRM) season compared to the baseline period, leading to risks associated with concurrent floods/landslides and droughts. These changes underscore the necessity for region-specific adaptation strategies to manage water resources effectively. Adaptation strategies to enhance short-term water storage during the ISM season could partially mitigate water shortages during the PRM season, offering potential benefits in the wake of climate change. Our findings highlight the need for integrated water resources management plans to address the challenges posed by climate change, ensuring sustainable water availability, agricultural productivity, and hydropower generation."

    "abstract": "Since the 2000 s the demand for sand has proliferated at the coastal-land interface to fill up the increasing demand straining Blue Economy (BE) activities and provision of water-energy-food resources. Recent studies have revealed that increased sand mining in both coastal and freshwater zones has continued to impact livelihood-ecological systems threatening the provision of livelihood goods and services. These impacts are exacerbated by a lack of comprehensive frameworks to regulate sand mining and trade; creating the need to develop micro and macro-frameworks and guidelines for sustainable sand mining. This paper uses a non-systematic literature review approach to build on this gap to develop an understanding of the resource nexus perspectives and trade-offs due to sand mining. The paper proposes a novel framework based on the Ecosystem Service Assessment advanced from the review of the literature to guide risk assessments toward more sustainable sand mining. In order to add evidence, the paper analyses in-depth the state of Kerala - one of India’s coastal states that has experienced unprecedented rates of sand mining since the 1990 s especially along the Chavara coast albeit with less research on the intersectionality of mining on the resource nexus. Both the framework and our case study highlight how sand mining stresses local ecosystems and livelihoods thus increasing vulnerability to both human and environmental impacts. The paper brings to the fore seven (7) key steps that local institutions can use to guide sustainable sand mining and build integrated governance systems that promote interaction among natural capitals in a given area and livelihood considerations. The article further documents that the use of coherent guidelines and the framework can help in amalgamating the various actors in a given system that can guide local participation in local resource management and the development of cooperative agreements for the sustainable utilization of resources among coastal communities. This could further help understand the resource nexus from the perspective of the synergies and trade-offs in the BE."

Globally, ABI has been validated in multiple languages. To date, empirical studies validating ABI in the South Indian population have not been carried out. Moreover, there is only minimal evidence on the impact of language and gender on ABI.\nObjectives\nThis study attempted to validate ABI in languages of Malayalam and Kannada with “B” and “G” of GRBAS. The authors also examined the influence of language and gender on ABI.\nMethods\nThe authors retrospectively analyzed a dataset consisting of 160 voice samples (91 normophonic and 69 dysphonic). Five speech-language pathologists perceptually evaluated these samples on the GRBAS scale. PRAAT software was used to calculate ABI for each voice sample. The authors also determined the effects of language and gender on ABI. Following this, ABI's concurrent validity and diagnostic accuracy were examined relating to “B” and “G” of the GRBAS scale.\nResults\nThe judges reached a moderate agreement on the perceptual evaluation of voice quality. The authors observed neither language nor gender differences in ABI. The concurrent validity of ABI was strong (r = 0.761) when correlated against “B”. Further, evaluations revealed that an ABI value of >3.66 could distinguish between breathy and non-breathy voice samples with an area under the curve of 0.816 (Sensitivity = 61.73%; Specificity = 94.93%). On the other hand, the concurrent validity of ABI in correlation with “G” did not yield the optimal result.\nConclusions\nABI is a valid acoustic tool for identifying breathiness in the languages of Malayalam and Kannada. ABI correlates better with “B” than “G” on the GRBAS scale. ABI is independent of language and gender."

    "abstract": "Many studies have shown that uncontrolled sand mining can have severe environmental consequences. Realizing these adverse impacts, the government of Kerala, India, regulated river sand mining. The construction industry in the state, the largest consumer of the mined sand, reacted by replacing river sand by manufactured sand (M-sand), which is obtained by crushing the stones quarried from the midlands and high ranges of the state. To assess the impact of sand mining ban on the biodiversity of Western Ghats, the areal expansion of 72 quarries within a 10 km buffer of protected areas was analysed. Using GIS and Google Earth Pro's Historical Imagery tool, we compared the quarries' average annual expansion over the three years preceding the ban with their expansion in 2016, the year the ban was fully enforced. The expansion in 2016 was 1.74 times the average annual increase over the decade, with some quarries more than doubling in area. A comparison with studies from other parts of the world suggests that increased quarrying can significantly affect the biodiversity of the Western Ghats. The study highlights the importance of more holistic and integrated approaches to formulating environmental policies and regulations, to prevent counterproductive outcomes."

    "abstract": "The paper examines the role of literature set in late 20th-century Kerala, India, at the intersections of class and gender, in establishing and propagating new ideals for children and childhood. During this period, Kerala gained recognition from the UN for its Kerala Model of Development, which positioned the state at the forefront of Human Development Indexes within a post-colonial country like India. Simultaneously, this era witnessed the introduction of children’s rights, based on the Western model, into a society where the legacy of colonialism had shaped various contours of modernity. Accordingly, children and childhood of the newly emerged middle class became significant within the developmental rhetoric of Kerala. The paper explores how the literary representation of these middle-class children and their childhood in selected Malayalam literature from Kerala reflects and caters to the construction of the agency a child should possess in a developing society. The paper argues that through the domestication and feminisation of childhood, these representations contributed to constructing a hegemonic model of middle-class childhood that emphasised the ‘becoming’ child, which gradually set the standard in Kerala society at the time. Despite being situated within the discursive practices of modernity, the literature produced during this period remained constrained by the aetonormative ideals of society."

    "abstract": "This paper delves into the narratives of male migrants from Northern Kerala who have established their lives in GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) countries. The migration pattern from Northern Kerala largely involves the male family members seeking employment in Gulf countries while their families remain in the homeland. This geographical displacement often leads to the recreation of their culture, including food, dress, religious and regional celebrations, which is nostalgically attached and embodied with memories of family members and community. Food, the foremost element, and the act of cooking the homeland food or mothers’ recipes play a crucial role in alleviating the displacement trauma among the migrants. Moreover, preparing and sharing home food or mothers’ recipes with friends and others has become a social networking strategy, allowing migrants to construct a collective social identity in the host nation. This paper is based on semi-structured interviews, both direct and online, from thirty migrants, either active or retired, based in the GCC countries."

    "abstract": "Historically, many Indigenous communities across the world have practiced seasonal burning to manage their local ecosystems. This practice shaped forest terrains worldwide and established an intentional and active relationship between humans and fire. Yet, perceived as a threat to wildlife and biodiversity, colonial policies have banned the burning of forests, and customary fire management remains a point of disagreement between conventional forest managers and Indigenous Peoples. This is particularly evident among Adivasis (Indigenous Peoples of India), whose use and understanding of fire are often disregarded in forest management, and the prohibition on traditional burning practices continues in India. Through open-ended interviews and transect walks in the Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary in the South Indian state of Kerala, we discuss Adivasi engagements with cultural burning. In this study, Adivasi members characterized fire as: (1) a preserver and groomer of landscape identity; (2) a co-manager and actor within specific forest terrains; and (3) an enabler of socio-ecological function and relationships. Through this, we explain human–fire coexistence—what enables it and how it benefits human–forest systems and fire's multifaceted role in many ecosystems. Fire clears up forests and supports Adivasi mobility, access within and interactions with forest ecosystems, and coexistence with wild animals. It enables the growth of grass and native trees, leading to a productive, functional, and healthy “good forest.” We argue that alternative fire dialogs provide opportunities for land management policies that better reflect distinct fire ontologies and for the practices that might then follow. Additionally, as forest fires increase, revisiting Indigenous perspectives can offer lessons for coexistence with fire to minimize its consequences in future landscapes."

    "abstract": "Situating the spatiality of Kochi both before and after the arrival of film studios and the setting up of technological apparatus required for making films within the city, this chapter offers a discussion of the spatiality of cinematic life through an analysis of the depiction of Kochi in Malayalam cinema.\n\nCities have been explored as a muse both in literature and cinema. In the latter, the dynamics between space and time are ones that truly make a film what it is. Essentially, it is the setting that comes to define the characters and it is the spatialisation of the plot that comes to define the aesthetics. In many films, a lot of the city becomes the story’s character as well. The films evoke in us an enduring urge to explore the world. \n\nThe partial relocation of the Malayalam film industry from Madras to Kochi through the establishment of studios creates a discontinuity in the images related to the city of Kochi. Interestingly, this change coincides with changes in the visual and technical aspects of cinema, engendered by the liberalisation policies in the 1990s. The author recounts the diverse ways in which social and cinematic life has evolved and suggests that material and technical aspects of film production are intertwined with urban social geographies."

Employing a multidisciplinary approach that integrates ethnographic fieldwork and theoretical analysis, it explores how rituals, processions, and performances create sacred spaces, transforming the urban landscape of Thiruvalla into a ‘religioscape’. The essay argues that the embodied interactions among devotees, deities, and spaces during the festival challenge existing binaries—corporeal versus spiritual, material versus nonmaterial, sacred versus profane—positioning the body as a site and medium of religious devotion and transformation. In doing so, the Uthra Śīvēli festival in Thiruvalla provides insight into the corporeal and spatial dimensions of Hindu devotional practices in contemporary Kerala."

    "abstract": "In Kerala, floods are considered as a major and most frequent hazard affecting about 14.8 % of the area and 52 % of the population being vulnerable to flood impacts. There are large differences between men and women in terms of impacts, vulnerabilities, and capacity to adapt to these challenges. Rural women are hard hit by the flood impacts especially due to constraining gender norms and high dependence on agriculture. Hence, the study aims to assess the Flood Vulnerability Index of Rural Women (FVIRW) for the selected Agro-ecological Units (AEUs) of Kerala, using the three dimensions of vulnerability viz, Adaptive capacity, Sensitivity and Exposure, under which 9 major components and 69 indicators were selected. The study was conducted in Pokkali Land and Kuttanadu AEU and was based on the primary data collected from 200 rural women through personal interviews. The developed FVIRW value indicated that rural women in both Pokkali Land (0.562) and Kuttanadu (0.551) are highly vulnerable. Probing into the dimensional values showed that Pokkali Land, had higher index value (0.679) for exposure followed by sensitivity dimension (0.671) and adaptive capacity (0.471). In case of Kuttanadu, the exposure dimension had higher value (0.687) followed by sensitivity (0.640) and adaptive capacity (0.464) dimension. In depth analysis in to the components like socio-demographic profile, livelihood strategies, socio-economic assets, water, health, and food indicated the need of urgent interventions at policy level. Hence to improve the current situation, adaptive interventions like schemes to improve the credit borrowing capacity of the women, linking women organizations to credit cooperative institutions, and mitigation interventions like conducting trainings on flood risk management and technology adoption, and insurance on assets loss can be implemented. The FVIRW developed can also be extended to other prominent flood vulnerable tracts of Kerala and other places with necessary modification."

    "abstract": "Defined as work undertaken by the body on oneself or others, bodywork has been understood as a key aspect of the service economy today. Since it involves encountering strange bodies, dealing with intimate parts and their waste products, such workers are looked down upon. Global inequality in terms of race, caste, and class structures the relationships between bodyworkers and their clients. Despite such iniquitous social relations, I suggest, bodyworkers construct antassu (dignity) for their work and themselves. I conceptualize Muslim barbers’ work in South India as dignified labor—labor as mediated by ideas of independence, autonomy, and integrity, achieved through the ownership of labor and their means. I suggest that we need to look at such stories as well, rather than attending only to narratives of inequality and suffering."

Phase 2 altruism scores of the AS pupils were higher and materialism scores were lower vis-à-vis the comparison group and their own phase 1 scores, with moderate effect sizes (Cohen’s d range=0.49–0.58, p=0.010–0.012). Within the AS cohort, at phase 2, girls, Hindus, middle class children, those whose mothers were their primary caregivers, single children, and those with above average scores on the self-reported religiosity and spirituality measures, most likely reported higher phase 2 scores on the altruism measure and lower on the materialism measure. The AS student program outlines a model of yoga-based moral education. Controlling or accounting for certain intervening variables, the AS program could be a prototype of value education in schools."

Patients under 18 years were invited to complete the MIQ before the start of treatment (T0) and 1 month after treatment completion (T1). The Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need and Peer Assessment Rating (PAR) scores were assessed at both time periods as well as a global transition judgement at T1.\n\nTwo hundred and ten participants were recruited and 162 completed both questionnaires (45.1% males; 54.9% females; age = 12–18 years, mean = 16.8; SD = 1.7). There was large reduction in MIQ scores from T0 (mean = 28.1, SD = 6.1) to T1 (mean = 3.7, SD = 2.6). \n\n53% reported a large improvement in oral health and related life quality after treatment, 32% minimal change, and 15% no change. None reported worsening in OHRQoL at T1. There was a significant positive correlation between change in MIQ score and change in PAR score (r = 0.358), pretreatment aesthetic component (rho = 0.467) and dental health component (rho = 0.491) of the index of orthodontic treatment (IOTN-DHC), and treatment time (rho = 0.502). Regression analysis revealed the change in PAR score and pretreatment IOTN-DHC to be independent predictors of change in MIQ score. Standardized effect size (4.0) and standardized response mean (2.9) were large and the minimal important difference was 7.7. Receiver operating characteristic analysis reported a high diagnostic accuracy of MIQ.\n\nThere was a significant improvement in OHRQoL following orthodontic treatment when assessed using a condition-specific measure for malocclusion. MIQ was found to be responsive to changes associated with orthodontic treatment."

    "abstract": "The global rise in twinning rates poses health challenges due to increased risks for infants and mothers. Despite the benefits, breastfeeding rates among multiples are low, with exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) particularly scarce compared to singletons. Our study focuses on the mothers of twins in a unique population in Kodinhi village, Kerala, India, known for its high twinning rates, which aims to contribute to existing knowledge of breastfeeding practices and perspectives in a high twinning environment and offer valuable insights to promote optimal breastfeeding among mothers of twins. A retrospective cross-sectional survey was adopted. Seventy-five mothers with twins under 3 years of age from Kodinhi and neighboring areas were interviewed face to face using structured validated tools. Data collection focused on quantitative data supplemented by narrative descriptions. Most women delivered preterm (57.3%), operative delivery (58.7%), and had a late initiation of breastfeeding (32.9% within 24 hours). Colostrum feed was common (86.7%). The EBF rate was 4%, with 47.9% initiating nonexclusive breastfeeding before 3 months, and most of the twins (46.6%) were breastfed for 1−2 years. Fatigue (69.9%) and low milk supply (38.7%) were chief concerns. While 16.4% of mothers opted for a tandem breastfeeding technique, many preferred consecutive feeding as tandem was challenging. Mothers in Kodinhi demonstrated commendable efforts in breastfeeding twins; despite the low rate of EBF, breastfeeding extended to 1−2 years. Evidence-based interventions and personalized support, primarily focusing on maternal perspectives of milk insufficiency, fatigue and breastfeeding techniques, are crucial for sustaining optimal breastfeeding practices among mothers of twins."

    "abstract": "Women are predominantly engaged in postharvest fisheries and comprise about 75% of those engaged in fish marketing in India. The roles performed by fisherwomen are often not recognised. With the recent penetration of technology, mechanisation, and capital orientation in fishing and fish vending, the business atmosphere has further turned against the interests of women. Women have to face competition in accessing fish, availing a prospective selling space, locating customers at their preferred time, and to adjust with the changing consumer preference to provide fish in a ready-to-cook form. \n\nWith this background, a study was undertaken among women fish vendors of the south Indian state of Kerala, to analyse their access to inputs and services and to collect gender-disaggregated data. A large level of regional variation was observed in terms of the involvement of women in fish vending owing to established cultural norms. There exists skewed access to inputs and services like fish, credit, ice, infrastructure facilities, transportation, and storage facilities for women in the state. \n\nWomen with poor social and economic networking were less privileged to have an incremental income from their traditional fish vending. There was a clear indication of the influence of financial capabilities such as employment days, volume, and variety of fish handled in determining the daily income of vendors. The inability to invest in fish vending activities was found to influence daily revenue. \n\nWe recommend the convergent efforts of various organizations to enhance the livelihood status of fisherwomen"

A world in which objects, entities, and words are all made of movement. Expanding a presence that resides in the flame of the lamp brought from the temple, kriya collects the elements of life—water, fire, death, wind, wealth, and more—from the nine gods of the cardinal directions. Although kriya is rooted in purity, sacredness, and worship, and although it clears pathways for the divine, nothing on a higher, exterior level is involved. Such a world is ‘inclusive:’ It includes within itself everything necessary for it to survive and thrive; nothing encompasses it. Following in detail how this world is created through kriya reveals some of the conditions and traits of an inclusive world."

    "abstract": "Abstract Despite India having a Muslim population higher than most of the Muslim countries, Muslims’ environmental engagements using Islamic idioms have remained under- theorized in studies on environmentalism in India. This article explores the salient features of Islamic environmentalism in Kerala by examining the engagements of Muslim socio-religious organizations and how they apply the Islamic teachings within the political landscape of Kerala. The article focuses on the Chaliyar struggle (1972), the first environmental struggle in Kerala with a popular base. The dominant strands of civil society portray Islamic environmentalism as a farce-mask or a survival tactic of Islamic fundamentalism to gain public legitimacy for specific religious values and are less concerned with environmental justice. Instead, this article argues that Islamic environmentalism is a political response to the contemporary ecological crisis that actively emanates from the sources of Islamic faith and communities. A close examination shows that Islamic environmentalism is significant example for religious sociability that evolves around Islamic teachings of ‘fasaad’ (trouble), ‘maslaha’ (common good), and the principle of ‘amr bil maʾruf wal nahy ʿanil munkar’ (enjoining the good and forbidding the wrong). Nevertheless, an over emphasize on the civil society framework in approaching environmentalism prevents from seeing these subtleties associated with Islamic environmentalism by deploying the secular-religious binary. Therefore, this paper proposes a theoretical re-imagination using the post-secularism studies to understand the nuances of Islamic environmentalism in times of growing ecological tensions."

    "abstract": "The connection between South Indian religious tensions and dietary discourses has not received enough attention in contemporary studies. Dietetics-related behaviour and narratives are now understood to be substantially more complex than previously believed, and victual exclusivity and separateness have emerged as two key indicators of religious tensions in modern South India. Recent political developments in the area demonstrate how the opposition between ‘vegetarian’ and ‘beef-eating non-vegetarian’ has gained significant traction in far-right, religious, and secular discourses in the area. In far-right discourses, eating meat has given rise to a kind of victual exoticism that also associates ‘beef eating’ with impurity, violence, and minority sexuality. While meat and mutton continue to be popular among the Malayali middle class; halal beef, halal certification, and halal restaurants have now come to represent disposable otherness in the region, which has been witnessing a steady and persuasive growth of various far-right ideologies. From this vantage point, this study examines the ongoing discussions about ‘halal’ and its significations and the social conflicts they have sparked in the past 3 years, with a focus on Kerala, the southernmost state in India."

    "abstract": "The gender discourse in South Asia has been intertwined with religious ideologies. Though not a homogenous category, women have carried the burden of community, tradition and faith on their bodies. In the Hindu sacral order, female divinities have been worshipped as a source of power and fertility and yet women have been denied access to material resources. Both tradition and modernity in India have been carriers of brahmanical patriarchal ideologies. The constitution of independent India has passed landmark laws to establish gender equality in all the fields of human endeavour, to create an egalitarian society. However, there are specific spaces prohibited for women, especially Hindu women due to biological reasons. This paper focuses on the idea of ritual purity which is the sine qua non of a Hindu woman’s existence, which promises not only a place in paradise but also the well-being of her earthly family. This ritual purity is manifested significantly as menstrual taboos during which women are scripturally debarred from religious spaces or rituals. This custom was legally challenged as contravening the idea of equality and the Supreme Court of India passed a judgment enabling women of all ages to worship at the Sabarimala shrine. Needless to mention it opened up a pandora’s box of conflicts between those who wish to keep the tradition intact and the others who welcomed the measure. The paper also analyses the legal judgments and the resultant narratives to argue that any attempt to tamper with the prevalent social morality will lead to a moral panic; which can be controlled only if female agency is contained. Further, the paper concurs with B. R. Ambedkar who pointed out that “the rights are protected not by law but by the social and moral conscience of society.”"

    "abstract": "Since the advent of Islam to Malabar, the northern region in the state of Kerala, the traditional practices of ritual healing have continued to be a significant aspect in everyday life of Muslims in this region. The Muslim public sphere of Malabar has been subjected to significant transformations in the last few decades as a direct result of notable changes in the socio-political and cultural domains. These changes subsequently paved the way for the process of democratisation and an attempt at institutionalisation of ritual healing knowledge which was once controlled and managed by a handful of elite Muslim families, such as the Thangals and Sayyids. The nature of the ritual structure, epic narratives in praise of divinities, their healing miracles, and the impact of saint cults on the Muslim community are driving forces of this democratisation process. Based on ethnographic insights collected from the field, this paper attempts to analyse the socio-historical journey of ritual healing in Malabar to analyse how the much-respected aristocratic virtue of the past has become an ordinary affair today by democratising the ritual-healing knowledge."

Additionally, the integral and inclusive nature of liturgical theology is often less respected by hermeneutical methodologies. Taking the privilege of writing of one's liturgical tradition in which one was born and brought up, this chapter provides a liturgical theological study of the Syro-Malabar Church (SMC). This Church follows East Syrian liturgical tradition. In the present Syro-Malabar liturgical celebrations one can find processions and a lot of singing. The celebrations of liturgy start with a solemn procession with St. Thomas cross, candles, Evangelium , and incense, and before the Gospel reading there is another procession from the altar to bema with incense and candles. The liturgical year of SMC and its structure constitute a plan for the faithful to meditate the salvation history through mysteries in a progressive manner."

    "abstract": "Abstract Memory and nostalgia form a core component in Jewish history, identity-production, and preservation. The Holocaust refers to a complex set of events, actions, and experiences faced by the Jewish community which had a global impact historically. The Jews who settled in India 2000 years ago were unaware of the torture their ancestry faced in Europe. They lived an active religious, social and cultural life. The formation of Israel led to Aliyah from 1948. The Indian Jews who migrated found it difficult to fathom the intensity of separation and harshness of the Promised Land. There is a dual engagement with memory for the Indian Jews: the aspirational memory for Israel by keeping the traditions; and the memory of the Indian homeland from Israel. The prospect of migration evoked the image of Israel through scriptures in the community. This notion shattered on reaching Israel as the landscape was despotic in quality. It led to a liminal existence and an overflow of memories through gatherings, food and folk songs. The paper aims to examine the cultural identity markers of the Indian Jewish community in relation to their embedded and experiential memory through food. The analysis aims to study the narratives of memory after migration to Israel. It also draws on the memoir Ruby of Cochin (2002) by Ruby Daniel and Barbara C. Johnson; and The Book of Esther (2002) by Esther David, to analyse the affective quality of food, songs and communal gatherings that operate as markers of memory before and after migration."

    "abstract": "This article explores the role of collective memory in the hagiographies of Malabar Muslims, particularly focusing on the representation of martyrdom in Mappila vernacular literature. Often dismissed by colonial and postcolonial scholars as mere fanaticism, these hagiographies, composed in Arabic-Malayalam, are re-examined as crucial sites of memory for the Mappila community. Through an analysis of kissappāṭṭŭ (narrative songs), especially the Cērūr Kissa, the study investigates how Mappilas canonized martyrs as walī Allāh (friends of God) and framed their sacrifices as spiritual and political acts of resistance against colonial and feudal forces. These hagiographies function as repositories of collective memory, intertwining Islamic ideals of sacrifice, heroism, and suffering with the Mappila community’s sociopolitical struggles. The article argues that these narratives offer valuable historical insights, countering colonial perceptions and highlighting the role of memory in shaping Mappila identity, religious devotion, and resistance in South Asia."

Kamalam, L. Baby, N. Thankam, and J. Jagadamma (popularly known as Kodangavila sisters) exercised their spiritual capital and crossed gender boundaries in the ministry space. They navigated their gender identity amidst the existing gender prejudices in the Pentecostal community. They exercised their spiritual capital as missionaries, Church planters, preachers, teachers, exorcists, leaders, prophetesses, etc. They influenced many people, including men, to dedicate their lives to the ministry. They worked ‘with’ male leadership without ‘openly’ challenging the patriarchal social etiquette and traditions. However, they covertly challenged the authority of male leadership. They followed the ‘accept-cum-reject’ approach for the male-female power equations in the ministry. This article attempts to narrate the unique characteristics of the life and ministry of the Kodangavila sisters, particularly how they used their spiritual capital to overcome the ‘disabilities’ of the female gender in an androcentric ministerial space/Church. They speak to contemporary Pentecostals, particularly women, and motivate them to channelize their spiritual capital as a tool of empowerment for equalizing ‘gendered’ space in ministry and community."

    "abstract": "Microplastic pollution has emerged as a critical global environmental issue, significantly impacting urban areas due to high population densities and intense human activities. Global plastic production surged from 1.5 million metric tons in 1950 to 413.8 million in 2023, exacerbating environmental contamination. In Kerala, India, microplastic pollution in urban ecosystems has escalated, affecting water bodies, soil, and marine biodiversity. This review explores the governance strategies and challenges in addressing urban microplastic pollution in Kerala, where plastic constitutes 4%–6% of municipal waste. Monsoon runoff and inadequate waste management exacerbate pollution, contributing to high microplastic concentrations in aquatic environments and marine organisms in Kerala. Findings from recent studies reveal elevated microplastic levels in lakes, coastal beaches, and seafood, highlighting the urgent need for improved waste management infrastructure, effective regulatory measures, and community engagement. The review also underscores the necessity of interdisciplinary research to better understand the sources, pathways, and impacts of microplastic contamination. Key recommendations include the adoption of robust regulatory frameworks, implementation of advanced monitoring technologies, and public education campaigns aimed at reducing plastic waste. By addressing these factors, the paper provides actionable insights for policymakers and stakeholders to develop effective strategies to combat microplastic pollution in Kerala's urban settings."

    "abstract": "This study evaluates the use of webs from two species of spiders, Cyrtophora cicatrosa and Pholcus phalangioides, as biomonitoring tools for heavy metal pollution across diverse environments in Kochi city, Kerala, India. Web samples from Thevara, Eloor, and Kizhakkambalam, representing urban, industrial, and semi-urban/agricultural areas, respectively, were analyzed for Cr, Cu, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sn, and Zn concentrations using ICP-OES spectroscopy. Results showed site-specific variation, with Zn reaching its highest concentration in Pholcus webs in Eloor (7558 ppm) and in Cyrtophora webs in Kizhakkambalam (4947.50 ppm). Relative distribution results revealed that Zn and Sn were the dominant metals accumulated in the webs across most sites. The principal component analysis (PCA) results highlight that Cyrtophora webs capture a broad range of metals from urban, industrial, and agricultural sources, while Pholcus webs show specific affinities for industrial and urban pollutants, suggesting a stronger sensitivity to urban-industrial pollution. These findings demonstrate that spider webs offer a cost-effective, species-specific, and non-invasive approach to environmental monitoring, enabling targeted pollution assessment and informing effective mitigation strategies across diverse settings."

    "abstract": "Indigenous ecological knowledge (IEK) has proven effective in environmental governance, forest management, and sustainable development, yet it is threatened by globalization and rapid social–ecological changes. In southern India, I investigated the engagement of the Kattunaicken community with the forest, particularly through honey collection, to explore the connection between their Indigenous epistemological identity and their role in caring for the forest and its inhabitants. I conducted 48 interviews and accompanied 11 forest walks as part of walking ethnography with male community members, who are primarily involved in honey collection within the Wayanad district of Kerala. The Kattunaicken identity was intrinsically linked to their knowledge of the forest, with reciprocal epistemological interactions between the community and forest entities (trees, animals, and bees). Honey collection emerged as an epistemological endeavor, manifesting their Indigenous identity through the collective “knowing” of the forest that encompassed sensorial, ethical, and metaphysical dimensions that facilitated harmonious coexistence and care for the forest and its inhabitants. The Kattunaicken world of knowing challenges extractivist interpretations of nontimber forest product collection, emphasizing the importance of Indigenous epistemologies in shaping alternative knowledge construction for forest conservation. Their epistemological framework highlights care as an active process emerging from collective understanding and negotiation among all entities within their shared epistemic realm, fostering a harmonious coexistence that transcends conservation efforts."

    "abstract": "Tamil Nadu and Kerala achieve the coastal flood disaster that leads to the maximum social and economic loss for India. The coastal flood prone methods used Sentinel 1A, Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), and Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment with Terrestrial Water Storage Anomaly (GRACE-TWSA) product in the Tamil Nadu and Ernakulam flood events. These data estimate the change detection of pre-flood and post-flood events, flood inundation mapping, and Reager’s Flood Potential Index (RFPI). Sentinel 1A was overlaid for four consecutive days to determine the portion of flood inundation mapping. Using GRACE-TWSA and TRMM data, the Flood Potential Index (FPI) used the RFPI method at a monthly scale. Then, RFPI, GRACE-TWSA, and TRMM data were compared for four cities of the flooded year in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, and Ernakulam, Kerala. Finally, flood inundation determined the 90-sq·km of the 2015 Chennai flood and 25-sq·km of the 2018 Ernakulam flood with the limited remote sensing data. Maximum RFPI between the postflood and preflood period (12 months) achieves the maximum, approximately 80% from the monsoon rainfall with approximately 20% of the total water storage to attain 100% at RFPI at both flooded years. The RFPI results monitor the prone locations from these extreme past floods on the south coast of India. The research insight shares the surplus water resources by the downpour from northeast monsoon in Tamil Nadu and southwest monsoon in Kerala. Downpour naturally disputes the water resources to sustain the socioeconomic reforms between interstates. The study also supports the policy of sustainable development goals in 11, 13, 14, and 15 in the future."

    "abstract": "Economic and social prosperity heavily relies on well-maintained highways. However, road maintenance faces challenges due to limited funding and resources, with potholes posing significant safety risks. This work introduces a pothole detector designed to detect and estimate pothole areas for timely maintenance. It enhances detection by modifying the YOLO algorithm, using the Xception backbone, and integrating attention mechanisms to improve the prediction of small or clustered objects. Xception’s depthwise separable convolutions enhance feature extraction, outperforming the standard YOLO algorithm in detecting small, irregular potholes and preventing overfitting. The improved YOLO model, along with spatial and channel attention mechanisms, focuses on relevant regions and refines important features specific to pothole areas. Accurate area estimation is achieved through computer vision and traditional segmentation processes. A custom dataset, including the MakeML pothole dataset, a Kaggle dataset, and real-time footage of Kerala roadways, is used for training and validation. Performance evaluation with mean average precision (mAP) and average precision (AP) metrics shows the pothole detector’s superiority, effectively identifying potholes under various conditions and ensuring safe road infrastructure."

    "abstract": "Economic development planning in the global South has proven to be a formidable undertaking, riddled with corruption, colossal waste of resources, and underwhelming successes. In 1993, aiming to reform development practices in India, the government of India amended the national constitution to encourage bottom-up development planning, a paradigmatic shift from the top-down approach generally used in the global South. In one Indian state – Kerala – these amendments sparked a “people’s planning movement” that over the last two decades has galvanized communities across the state, resulting in development projects that would not have happened otherwise, tangibly improving the quality of many people’s lives. In this paper, we review the economic growth and community development outcomes from these amendments in Kerala, examining one local nonprofit, Thalikulam Vikas Trust, and its accomplishments. Our goal is to share our understanding of the causes and consequences of a remarkable grassroots planning experiment in Kerala."

    "abstract": "Conducted from 1996 through 2001, the People’s Campaign for Decentralized Planning (PPC) in Kerala, India, sought to promote participatory democracy by establishing structures and processes to maximize direct involvement of citizens in planning and budgeting. Linking planning and budgeting to efforts to eradicate poverty, mitigate inequalities, and empower historically disadvantaged citizens, the PPC sought to capitalize on local knowledge, while also using participatory decision-making as a means to change attitudes and behaviors associated with sexist, class-based, and anti-caste prejudices that impede egalitarian civic culture. This paper analyzes two critical components of PPC designed to empower the most marginalized citizens in Kerala: women and the Adivasi or Scheduled Tribes. Through detailed examination of processes of mobilization, conscientization, and empowerment targeting these groups, I assess the possibilities and limitations of planning processes devised to politicize and redress the grievances of the dispossessed. In particular, I contrast the depth of participation, the nature and quality of deliberative processes, and the substantive outcomes of participation for these two marginalized groups."

    "abstract": "Women in the global south are at the heart of sustainability debates, persistently portrayed as having affinity with their biodiverse natural environments. These representations are incongruent amidst transformations of the global south into sites of consumerism, in which women participate as much as men. Consequently, there is little critical development of ‘women-environment’ debates with respect to women’s roles as consumers. This paper, set in the context of Kerala, southern India, uses feminist perspectives of practice theory to explore the normative socio-cultural contexts that engender particular acts and discourses of sustainability and consumption. Interviews, conducted across urban centres, highlight two contrasting women-centred discourses of sustainability: the first, echoing environmental justice advocates, locates women as naturally allied to leading sustainable consumption practices in the home, and change agents in their communities. In contrast, the second challenges the idea of women’s unique adeptness in sustainability, arguing instead that such narratives reinforce burdens of sustainability, negate women’s rights, and tacitly reassert patriarchal control. Space is implicated in these worldviews and practices, firstly at a material level, in terms of their perceived relationship with their natural environments, and, secondly, as a political construct defining their public-private roles. Understanding women’s everyday efforts to practice responsible consumption reveals deeper questions about whether sustainability works for women as much as they do for sustainability."

It explores the history of the area’s local industrialisation, the presence of varied economic interests and exposes the barriers to forming solidarity networks among the working classes.\n\nSituated in the backdrop of the Eloor-Edayar industrial belt, this book delves deeper into the ways in which capitalism infiltrates and manipulates the social movement landscape in Kerala. It shows how the hegemonic coalition between the state, industries and institutionalised trade unions enable capitalist rationality to mediate and control social movements in postcolonial settings.\n\nUsing an ethnographic approach, the book seeks to embark on a journey to understand the tensions between two progressive social movements – a trade union collective and a local environmental movement – foregrounding the experiences of members of the respective groups. The analysis presented here shows how the contestations/conflicts between the movements stem from interpretive as well as ideological differences surrounding economic development and environmental justice."

This study examined the risk perceptions of the residents living in proximity to the Brahmapuram dump yard, situated in Ernakulam district of Kerala State, India- A site marked by persistent local protests, public outrage, and legal disputes arising from issues related to waste mismanagement. The study focused on the geospatial and sociodemographic factors that might influence these perceptions. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 302 respondents living within 4 kilometers from the borders of the dump yard using a structured interview schedule. The responses of the participants were used to compute a risk perception score, which reflected participants’ risk perception regarding the environment and their health. Among the participants in the study, those who lived within 2 kilometers (2.3 (95% CI 0.96, 3.7; p<0.001)), those who lived to the east (2.7 (95% CI 1.1, 4.2; p<0.001)) and those who reported perceiving strong malodor from the dump yard (2.0 (95% CI 0.54, 3.4; p=0.007)), had a higher risk perception in the multivariate linear regression model. Women had a lesser risk perception compared to men (−2.6 (95% CI −3.7, −1.4; p<0.001)). The findings highlight the importance of geospatial characteristics (distance and direction), malodor and gender differences in shaping the risk perceptions among the proximate residents living around a waste dump yard. Consideration of geospatial and sociodemographic determinants in risk assessment and management could potentially reduce the perceived risks and public discontent around waste management facilities."

While the incidence of killings has come down during the last five years due to the intervention of the party leaders at the highest level, in the absence of reconciliation efforts, the situation in the villages remains grim. Because the parties monopolize all space for intervention, the only sphere where a beginning can be made is through education and the training of peace cadets. The paper discusses the nuances of organizing peace cadets, the training that needs to be provided, and the pedagogy for realizing it with the hindsight of the first author’s experience as a peace activist, peace education teacher, and training module preparation. The paper adopts the methodology of autoethnography."

The heavy metal concentration of the sediments, particularly V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, Ba, Zr, As, Sr, and Pb, is determined using the EDXRF technique. The magnetic susceptibility measurement was conducted at two different frequencies: a low frequency of 0.47 kHz and a high frequency of 4.7 kHz. These measurements were then used to calculate the frequency-dependent susceptibility, also referred to as χfd The low frequency mass magnetic susceptibility values range from 7 × 10−8 m3 kg−1 to 205 × 10−8 m3 kg−1, with an average of 85.59 × 10−8 m3 kg−1. The high magnetic susceptibility values range from 5 × 10−8 m3 kg−1 to 182 × 10−8 m3 kg−1, with an average of 74.27 × 10−8 m3 kg−1. A multivariate statistical analysis was performed to investigate the correlation between magnetic susceptibility and the concentration of heavy metals in sediments. A significant association established between magnetic susceptibility and the heavy metals such as V, Zn, Mn, Ba, As, and Pb. This suggests that these elements are affected by anthropogenic magnetic particulate matter and this type of contamination is of anthropogenic origin. A spatial distribution map a distinct visual representation of the magnetic susceptibility in the study area. The principal component analysis (PCA) results indicated a significant relationship between heavy metals and magnetic susceptibility values. The cluster analysis identified two distinctive groups, suggesting a relationship between the levels of heavy metals and magnetic susceptibility values. The analysis of the Pearson correlation coefficient revealed an association between magnetic susceptibility and the concentration of the studied heavy metal. The current investigation demonstrates that magnetic susceptibility is a rapid, cost-effective, and non-destructive technique for identifying contaminated sediments."

    "abstract": "This paper explores why, despite a deep-rooted passion for football and the daily participation of youth in the game, Malappuram, or Malabar in general, fails to produce players of global calibre. We argue that the habitus of these players, shaped primarily by the dominance of seven-a-side (SS) matches, limits their exposure and training, hindering their development for eleven-a-side (ES) football. After analysing the region’s passionate football culture, we highlight key differences between SS and ES formats, including pitch size, stamina demands, hazardous terrain, inadequate physical conditioning, rule discrepancies, limited tactical complexity, and infrastructural challenges. Drawing on sociological theories, particularly Pierre Bourdieu’s concept of habitus, we explain how the ingrained dispositions of SS football limit players’ performance in ES matches. We propose strategies to address these challenges, emphasizing the need to discourage SS matches and promote ES football to develop players of global calibre and establish a structured professional football ecosystem."

    "abstract": "Kerala, a Southern Indian state, has recently witnessed a new wave of religious and political opposition against ‘gender politics’, a term increasingly used to criticize progressive changes concerning gender and sexuality. This article positions the ongoing discursive shift around ‘gender’ in Kerala’s public sphere as a distinctive anti-gender mobilization, emerging partly through ideological reliance on Western anti-gender movements and partly diverging from them. Through a critical discourse analysis of major events from the past 6 years, this paper traces the manufacturing of anti-gender mobilization in Kerala and its role as a new (pseudo)intellectual framework and vocabulary of social conservatism, emphasizing how trans-queer bodies and gender-just initiatives in educational spaces have become sites of ‘gender debates’. Texts produced around these occurrences are analysed alongside insights from interviews with queer-trans student activists. By examining the ongoing interaction between numerous local and global agents of anti-gender politics, which surprisingly align with both fascist and anti-fascist, liberal and illiberal, secular and religious formations in Kerala, this paper suggests the necessity of rethinking the geo-political nuances involved in imagining liberatory political discourse."

    "abstract": "To understand the relevance of contemporary public libraries in India, and how these institutions help to foster community engagement, this paper focuses on the civic engagement initiatives undertaken by the State Library Council in Kerala, India. The council has introduced several community forums at public libraries across Kerala such as Children’s forum, Women’s forum, Youth forum and Elderly forum. Each forum focuses on specific demographics within the community who take part in various programs offered by the library based on their needs. A structured questionnaire was distributed to 111 public librarians across Kerala, followed by interviews with librarians, and direct observations in libraries, which helped gather information on how public libraries are conducting a range of community programs to boost civic participation. The libraries selected for this research included the State library, District libraries, Taluk libraries, Village libraries, Grama panchayat libraries, Municipal libraries and Tribal libraries. The findings show that village libraries play a prominent role in organising civic engagement initiatives when they design and run community forums that suit patrons’ different needs."

    "abstract": "Sacred groves are culturally protected forest fragments that are considered numinous by local communities and found all over the globe. In the densely populated Malabar Coast of India, Indigenous ecological knowledge admonishes that sacred groves not be disturbed, lest fresh water sources run dry. This paper develops the significance of the spatial distribution of sacred groves and its implications in climate change adaptation as nature-based solutions. We employ literature review, field surveys, first-hand observations and spatial analysis of 392 sacred groves to understand spatial patterns of sacred groves in the context of the drainage-recharge patterns of the region. The finding that sacred groves are located proximal to the stream network has parallels with riparian vegetation conservation. These forest patches are conserved through faith systems, rooted in Indigenous ecological knowledge. It underlines the importance of policy interventions to protect sacred groves that currently lack legal backing for conservation."

    "abstract": "Sacred groves range in size from a single tree to large intact forest areas containing deities that are worshiped and protected by people through belief systems. India has over 100,000 groves, known by various local names. Groves are shrinking due to changes in lifestyle, sociocultural change, and waning trust in associated myths and beliefs. The primary objective of this study was to explore the sociocultural practices and management systems that support the sacred groves in Kerala. We conducted a systematic review of studies about aspects of sacred groves, with a focus on the state of Kerala. Our review used a survey of online databases such as Scopus, Google Scholar, Pubmed, and Web of Science, as well as offline libraries. We grouped articles into: sociocultural aspects; management; and biodiversity. Decline in size of groves poses a threat to both the biological diversity of the groves as well as the sociocultural systems that have been handed down through generations. There is a need to document the significance and diversity of sociocultural systems associated with the sacred groves and also the dynamic changes impacting the biodiversity supported by the groves, which are testimonials of social and cultural heritage and belief systems in Kerala."

    "abstract": "The study aimed to assess the digital literacy skills of the students of Sacred Heart College, Chalakudy, to know whether they possess the digital literacy skills to perform well in the digital environment. The study also analyzed how digital literacy skills were affected by various factors.,The study used stratified random sampling technique, and data were collected through a self-assessment survey using an online questionnaire designed based on DigComp 2.1: The Digital Competence Framework by the European Commission.,The results indicated that the college students needed training on digital literacy skills, as the majority students had only moderate to low digital literacy skills. It was proven that exposure to technology and the Internet will not necessarily yield skills to perform well in the digital environment. Also, digital literacy skills were not affected by various factors like age, level of study, etc.,The study helped to identify the digital literacy deficiencies in the students of Sacred Heart College, and it can serve as a valuable model for conducting similar investigations in diverse educational institutions. Conducting such studies offers institutions valuable insights, enabling them to create and implement personalized digital literacy training programs that can enhance students' abilities to navigate the digital landscape with proficiency and effectiveness. The study results can be insightful for educators, policymakers and the Kerala Government to reassess the current approaches and design an effective curriculum for integrating technology in education.,Although there are several studies that evaluated college students’ digital literacy in India and other countries, there are very few studies in the context of Kerala. Therefore, this study is distinctive and will serve as an example for all such studies in the future."

It explores how the educational aspirations of Adivasi community are placed in the local development discourse. A brief review of the neighbourhood–school relationship, especially in the context of existing social inequality, is explored in the introduction. Then the article is divided into two parts. The first part of the essay focuses on the historical experience of marginalisation in the regional mainstream and the local imaginations of Adivasi development. The second part focuses on how the school has historically evolved within this regional mainstream and how it responds to the educational aspirations of Adivasi. This essay tries to understand how the experience of marginality is created and sustained in Adivasi neighbourhoods that are sandwiched in the regional mainstream in Kerala. How do Adivasi communities articulate their educational aspirations? And how does the school in the neighbourhood respond to these aspirations over a period of time? The empirical observations of the article is gathered through a yearlong fieldwork conducted in 2014 and a revisit conducted in 2019."

    "abstract": "Schools are considered a liberation and social mobility tool in our public imagination. However, many critical studies point out that schools are reproducing the existing inequalities in many ways. In a multicultural society like India, the sensitivity of the school to the differences and its strategies to address the multiplicity of the social and economic backgrounds of the students will have a lasting impact on the academic and personal development of the children. In a historically stratified society, it is significant to see what role schools play irrespective of the policies or curriculum frameworks. \n\nThis study is the product of 1 year of ethnographic fieldwork in a government higher secondary school in Kerala during 2013–2014 and a revisit in 2018–2019. It employs a critical ethnographic method to understand how hierarchy and stigma are constructed in the everyday classroom in the context of Adivasi students. \n\nThe idea of citizenship is employed to understand this context. It is a modern imagination of being a nation-state member with some bestowed rights. If we follow the idea that schooling is a preparation for life, it prepares students to be citizens of our society. This paper explores how the citizenship experience of the Adivasi children is being shaped in our schools. \n\nA government school in Kerala where all sections of the society are studying is taken for the study. How is the learning context organised in the school? How are Adivasis’s social identity, knowledge and experiences placed in the school? How these things shape the citizenship experience of Adivasi children are some of the questions this paper attempts to explore."

They are also markers of the recent opening of religion to individual contribution and intervention, as well as active tools for the intimate worshipper–deity relationship. \n\nRitual arts conducted as votive offerings allow us to dive even deeper into these considerations and open up new alleys of analysis, for they connect public and private worlds in specific ways and introduce unique aesthetic and transactional dimensions. \n\nThis article draws on extensive ethnographic fieldwork conducted in the south Indian state of Kerala, with particular focus on the ritual performing art mutiyettu’, which is mainly conducted as a votive offering in high-caste temples devoted to the goddess Bhadrakāḷi. It pulls together anthropology, performance, and religious studies to analyse the current grassroot-level realities of lived popular religion through the prism of votive offerings in general and of ritual performing arts conducted as votive offerings in particular."

    "abstract": "This chapter reads the Malayalam film <i>The Great Indian Kitchen</i> (Baby, 2021) as a site to disentangle a film text after the OTT revolution and raises questions related to gender, experience, and spectatorial subjectivities. It places “experience” as an important category interlinking problems of cinematic “aesthetics” and the “everyday” that the discourse around the film has generated. Experience is perceived at different levels: the “sensorial experience of the kitchen” which the film created, the numerous personal experiential notes by female audience on social media after watching the film, the altering of the gendered spectatorial subjectivities of the so called “family movie”, and the dalit feminist critique of the female experience provided by the film.\n\nWe argue that through different formal and aesthetic means, the film creates a “sensorial experience of the kitchen” which unsettles the received perceptions about the kitchen space, especially in relation to reading kitchen as a space of labour. The writings by female audience on social media after watching the film are analysed in detail to understand why they were memoirs or reflections on their own personal life experiences rather than appreciation of the film's aesthetic and argue that these Facebook notes forge a continuity between the filmic space and the space of the social media as a site for the production of memory/knowledge. It tries to see whether the film's reception further signals a reconstitution of the familial and spectatorial subjectivities, especially in relation to what the Malayalam film industry has called “the family movie”.\n\nThe last part of the chapter briefly responds to some of the questions raised from a dalit feminist standpoint in order to problematise the question of experience and its relation to women empowerment today."

The purpose of the study is to examine how celebrity brand loyalty is impacted by the different dimensions of stability, such as morality, honesty, and consistency. The prior studies in this area explain the antecedents and consequences of personal brand authenticity, but the impact of stability dimensions (an antecedent of personal brand authenticity) on celebrity brand loyalty (a consequence of personal brand authenticity) is unexplained by the available literature. The study is conducted using primary data collected from the samples collected from 286 respondents, randomly selected from the Kerala state of India. Those who follow a celebrity from the film industry are included as respondents. The analysis of the data is done using Structural Equation Modelling. A multigroup analysis was done to test the moderating effect of celebrity gender on these study relationships. It is found that consistency, candidness, and morality are positively affecting their brand loyalty. The result of the multigroup showed no significant difference between male and female celebrity gender groups regarding the studied relations. Thus, celebrities and other professionals can manage their personal brand by maintaining stable actions."

Death, marking the cessation of an organism’s independent existence and its return to a nonliving state, is observed by the Irulas in a unique ceremony known as cheeru and an annual feast ceremony for the ancestors known as Kanji Seeru. This paper aims to delve into the underlying practices of the Irula death ceremony and the associated ritualistic practices and the transformation of traditional practices are also enquired based on empirical research. The research adopts a qualitative methodology, with primary data gathered through ethnographic fieldwork and the secondary data is collected from the published sources."

This conventional understanding, however, overlooks the multifaceted roles bali rituals play, especially in the mortuary practices of the Māvilan communities in Kasaragod district, northern Kerala. \n\nThis ethnographic study explores the transformative role of bali rituals in converting the deceased into Anannu teyyam performances among the Mavilans, thereby facilitating communication between the living and the dead and venerating ancestral pasts through Torram and Cacitra oral traditions. \n\nEmploying Victor Turner’s concept of liminality as a theoretical framework, the research examines how these rituals navigate the transitional phases of death, enabling a seamless passage and continued presence of the deceased within the community’s cultural and spiritual landscape. This study underscores the importance of localised ethnographic inquiry in uncovering the complex interplay between ritual, belief, and social structure in shaping communal experiences of death and transformation."

Many continue to face state-sanctioned discrimination. Kerala stands out in supporting and advancing transgender people. \n\nWe interviewed 15 government officials and 28 transgender women to explore how the Kerala government uplifted and improved the lives of its transgender people. Using a grounded theory approach, we analyse Kerala’s (one of the most progressive states in India) efforts to support transgender people. We found that access to common good—linked with citizenship, active participation, and collective action in society—is key to connect policies with outcomes for socially marginalised groups. Our study emphasises how representative bureaucracy can empower society’s most vulnerable individuals and help them establish nonprofit organisations for their own support. This discovery allowed us to enhance and develop a process-based theory of representative bureaucracy. Our study extends the theory by establishing the mechanisms by which representative bureaucracy delivers the common good to society’s marginalised members."

    "abstract": "Groundwater resources are increasingly strained by misuse and climate change, necessitating the identification of potential recharge zones for sustainable management. The study aimed to simulate potential recharge zones of a tropical river basin using two multi-criteria decision-making techniques: the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Multi-Influencing Factor (MIF) methods. Thematic layers of key variables were integrated using a weighted overlay analysis in GIS environment to model recharge areas within a tropical river basin in Northern Kerala, India. Normalized weights and ranks were calculated to evaluate their influence on groundwater development. Five classes of groundwater recharge potential zones (GWRPZ) with their derived areas were identified for AHP and MIF, respectively: high (30.39% and 28.24%), low (21.55% and 21.60%), very high (19.20% and 18.45%), moderate (16.96% and 20.25%), and very low (11.90% and 11.45%). Validation with overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient confirmed the methods' comparability. The results guide water well site selection and improve managed aquifer recharge (MAR) strategies. Local bodies within the river basin were ranked utilizing the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method to prioritize and implement recharge schemes, aiding sustainability goals in groundwater management."

    "abstract": "Cnidarian jellyfish are common components of marine food webs, though a small number of species also thrive in freshwaters. Freshwater jellyfish (class Hydrozoa) are not uncommon in tropical and subtropical India. Several genera, each with few (&lt;10) species, are represented. The non-indigenous Peach Blossom Jellyfish Craspedacusta sowerbii has, however, only been sighted thrice in India in the past; twice (2009 and 2016) in Kerala State, southwest India. We report on a mass occurrence of C. sowerbii in a small freshwater water body (Chirakkal pond, Karurkadavu village, Karunagapalli, Kollam District) following a major flood event in August 2018. We provide notes on environmental conditions present and the jellyfish bloom characteristics. This report establishes the presence of the invasive species in the water bodies of Kerala and its post-flooding, adding it to the 32 already reported aquatic alien species in the state. While the fate of the herein-reported C. sowerbii population explosion in Kerala State is not entirely known, we call for more regional awareness and research attention, including community involvement."

The issue in question is the validity of a declaration of unilateral repudiation (ṭalāq) using a particular grammatical construction uttered in front of the husband’s mother-in-law (known locally as the ‘Valapuram Ṭalāq’ case). The effectiveness of this particular form of divorce continues to divide jurists in the community in question, all of whom defer to the authority of the same canonical legal texts, namely the Tuḥfat al-Muḥtāj of Ibn Ḥajar al-Haytamī (d. 974/1566), the Nihāyat al-Muḥtāj of Shams al-Dīn al-Ramlī (d. 1004/1596) and the Fatḥ al-Muʿīn of the prominent Keralite jurist Aḥmad Zayn al-Dīn al-Malaybārī (d. 991/1583)."

The Covid-19 has had an impact on the socio-economic well-being of Kerala’s PVTG’s. Because PVTGs rely on the forest and forest products for a living, collecting and selling forest products is regarded as their primary source of income. Any disruptions in the collection and sale of forest produce have an impact on their livelihood. The COVID-19 and post-covid health issues had a significant impact on the collection and sales of Non-Timber Forest Produce (NTFP). This study seeks to comprehend the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the collection and sales of NTFP. The Kattunaikars and Kurumba tribes of Muthanga Forest area, Wynand (Kattunaikans Tribal location) & Attappady, and Aanavay forest area, of Palakkad District(Kurumba tribal location) participated in the study. For this study, a semi-structured interview schedule was used. 40 PVTGs were interviewed. Thematic analysis is used in this study. Also to understand the relevance of the issues we have also given a rank order based on the participants’ responses to the issues."

In so doing, it analyses Mappila Muslim male pious subjects belonging to the south Indian region of Malabar vis-à-vis discursive configuration of a panopticon self through vigilance of the gaze of God, Islamic social etiquettes and body adornments, and marital relations. Examining their personal and embodied forms of reflexive masculinities, and how Islamic piety is mobilized as a power resource for such transcendent configurations, the article illustrates how Islamic piety acts in effect to enable these men to embody gentler and more feminized forms of masculinities. Inculcating these men with what may be core religious values but also culturally designated as quintessentially feminine, Islamic piety in this context functions as technologies of self to produce reflexive identities."

This intersection between historical, generational and personal time allows insights into the temporal complexity of migration journeys: it casts light on how contemporary healthcare migration cumulatively builds on the longer-term relevance of religious networks. The analysis suggests how religion contributes to the layering of healthcare migration through professionalization, precarization and subordinate valorization."

These foundational narratives are compared with non-native colonial and other sources, including manuscripts, books, letters and reports located in libraries and archives, in order to see whether there is any synchronicity between the different versions. Of particular interest is the gender dimension in which Divekar’s release from prison was facilitated by a Muslim woman, reminiscent of the biblical story of Joseph and Potiphar’s wife in Egypt. Although prominent in the Bene Israel communal narrative, the Begum’s role is reflected neither in colonial records nor in other accounts (notably, in Cochin Jewish letters). Finally, the question of whether Divekar brought a Torah scroll to the Gate of Mercy synagogue (so named to commemorate the compassion of the Begum) established in 1796 in Bombay is discussed. The article demonstrates that the analysis of subaltern oral narratives can enrich our understanding of history by giving a voice to marginalised groups, and focusing on suppressed narratives about gender."

Our aim is to assess the repercussions of host and home country circumstances on their return preparedness and its subsequent affliction on their employability prospects. Data was collected from return migrants from the Gulf Cooperation Council, and quantitative methodology was employed, utilising a partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) approach for analysis based on data gathered from the survey. The findings elucidate that external constraints in the home country significantly undermine the employability of returnees from GCC nations. Personal adversities, including familial obligations, health issues and a negative self-perception of one’s own employability, further exacerbate the challenges emigrant Gulf returnees face in securing stable employment. Besides, the study accentuates the significance of reintegration preparedness in achieving economic stability through enhanced employability. Comprehending the influence of pre and post-return circumstances and the degree of preparedness to return on the employability prospects of EGR provide valuable insights for policymakers. This understanding enables the development of tailored interventions that address the unique requirements and obstacles encountered by them."

    "abstract": "There are no published guidelines regarding remotely training research assistants (RAs) to conduct neuropsychological tests. With technological advances allowing for increased international collaboration within the medical and research communities, challenges often arise from such partnerships, including linguistic, cultural, and physical barriers. A notable challenge for supervising neuropsychologists in international projects is the physical distance from RAs, sites, and materials, making training/supervision of RAs and monitoring test data quite challenging. In the context of a research collaboration between neuropsychologists based in New York and RAs based in Kerala, India, as part of the Kerala-Einstein Study, we explore the obstacles of remotely training RAs and maintaining neuropsychological data integrity. We share lessons learned and systems developed to optimize remote, multilingual, cross-cultural training of RAs in administration/scoring of neuropsychological tests. One-on-one video training sessions mitigated logistical problems (i.e., time differences, internet connection, language comfort). Individualized training in scoring and a centralized individual to double-score protocols addressed quality assurance of test data. Close collaboration between our teams was necessary for cultural competency, particularly when building an appropriate test battery, creating and translating manuals, and adapting protocols. Finally, frequent and ongoing communication channels ensured excellence in study design, information gathering, and data quality. Future studies should continue highlighting strategies for remotely training psychometrics/RAs in neuropsychological administration."

Competing, sometimes rivalling, and appropriating other Sufi religiosities, the Alawi order meaningfully involved within the theo-legal Sufi discourses that have been remoulding the Sufi cosmopolis in the Indian Ocean. By focusing on two notable early immigrant Sayyids in Malabar, this article argues that the successful placement of the ʿAlawī order within the Sufi cosmopolis and the permeation of the ritual was a complex socio-religious project that was brought forth by various aspects of the sacred genealogy, Alawi Sufi writings, Sufi activism, and the effective utilisation of Hadrami immigrant networks."

    "abstract": "Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) outbreaks have repeatedly occurred in two districts of Kerala state, India, over the last few years. The outbreaks in the wetland areas coincided with the arrival of migratory birds. At the time, the factors responsible for local transmission in ducks were not known. This study aimed to identify the socio-economic factors responsible for spatial variation in the occurrence of HPAI outbreaks in the two districts using Bayesian network modelling (BNM) and Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE) model. Further, information was collected on the duck rearing practices in rice paddy fields to identify the risk factors for local – spread of the outbreaks. We found that the SPDE model without covariates explained variation in occurrence of outbreaks. The number of rice paddy fields used by the duck farmers was identified as risk factor. We concluded based on BNM and SPDE that the infected migratory birds were the source of infection for the first few duck farms in the wetland areas and subsequent transmission was driven by shifting of ducks from one rice paddy field to other fields. There is a probability of persistent and recurrent infections in the ducks and possible spill over to humans. Hence, it is important to have surveillance in ducks to prevent recurrent outbreaks in the region."

    "abstract": "Low-wage labor migrants experience major human and working rights abuses in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries despite national labor laws and signatures to various human rights conventions. On paper, India has established an institutional framework of transnational social protection for its officially estimated 5.5 million low-wage workers migrating to the Gulf Cooperation Council countries, e.g., financial emergency support, repatriation services, and walk-in centers. However, migrants in low-wage employment often cannot access substantive social rights in practice. Indian upper/middle-class migrant civil society groups mediate their access to Indian embassies’ services and the destination countries’ state institutions. The realization of social rights via informal, third-party representation stems from a representational disjuncture between low-wage labor migrants and the Indian state, which is rooted in their historical socioeconomic marginalization, limitations of the formal political system, and the constitutive role of informality in shaping and structuring citizen-state interactions in India. Through the lens of Piper and von Lieres’ (2015) concept of mediated citizenship and based on data from semi-structured interviews and participant observation of migrant support networks in the Gulf countries, this article examines why mediation takes place and how volunteers speak and take action for marginalized migrants in low-wage employment and consequences of mediation. It argues that migrant volunteer organizations and individuals are powerful stakeholders in the migration governance in the GCC region, as they possess leverage over who has (better) access to state institutions and the provision of social and human rights. Their status as intermediaries underlines the disaggregation of Indian citizenship along class and caste lines, which can be (mis)-used by mediators to pursue their interests, resulting in ambiguous effects. The article contributes to perspectives on migration governance in the GCC region, transnational social policies, and migrant volunteering."

Given the complexity of human rights concerns in residential aged care, the intersection of older adults, human rights, and social work is a crucial matter for discussion. The present study explores the commonalities and variations in the social workers’ perceptions of rights-based practices (RBP) with older adults in the residential aged care facilities of Ontario, Canada, and Kerala, India, in two contexts, one from the Global North and the other Global South, both with rising demand for aged care facilities. Nineteen social workers participated in the interview following data saturation. The analysis grounded in Colaizzi’s descriptive phenomenology has revealed four themes and 13 cluster themes. Most participants were from private residential aged care facilities, which might have influenced their views and experiences. The identified themes “essential considerations for effective RBP in RACFs”, “vital functions of social workers for RBP in RACFs”, “perpetual competency building for RBP in RACFs”, and “challenges to RBP implementation in the RACFs” are presented and discussed."

Hence, the study would offer an assessment of Makti’s reformist initiatives and writings in Malayalam between the closing decades of the nineteenth century. Locating him as a central figure in the new public arena, this study seeks to analyze his multi-faceted efforts to the emergence of a Mappila/Muslim modernist discourse along with the realms of religion, language and education."

    "abstract": "Food has been invented, consumed, modified, and evolved through the ages based on social conditions. This influence can be seen in Kerala, a South Indian state along the Arabian Sea, which has been part of the colonial expedition. The culinary heritage of Kerala is a unique blend of foreign influences from Arabs, Chinese, Portuguese, Dutch, and British who arrived on its shores. In this context, the aim of the study is to focus on the authenticity of Kerala’s traditional dish, meen curry, in relation to culinary nostalgia and familial identity. The research paper will provide a comprehensive analysis of meen curry and the ingredients used in Kerala-style restaurant, studio kitchen, toddy shop, and heirloom recipes to understand how the dish is prepared in various settings within and outside the state as an agent of culinary traditions and nostalgia. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with six participants to explore the gastronomic landscape of Bangalore and Kerala with respect to the authenticity of meen curry. The qualitative data from these interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis and categorized into three relevant themes. The findings of the study suggest that the authenticity of meen curry of Kerala is variable and subjective, and one single form of “authentic” meen curry that represents entire Kerala does not exist. The research will contribute to the current academic knowledge on how the authenticity of food is perceived by communities or individuals and suggests that this perspective may be applicable to other societies or cuisines for future research."

    "abstract": "Dirofilariasis is a globally significant emerging-zoonotic-disease caused by nematode parasites belonging to the genus Dirofilaria (Rhabditida: Onchocercidae) and is transmitted by mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) of the Culicidae family. A recent study on molecular prevalence of Dirofilaria sp. “hongkongensis” To, 2012 (nomen nudum) among the dog population in Kerala indicated a high infection rate. However, no data are currently available on the vectors involved in the transmission of this disease. In this study, an entomological survey was conducted to detect natural infection and to characterize the Dirofilaria parasite from Kani tribal settlements in Thiruvananthapuram, India. A total of 356 mosquitoes were collected, morphologically identified, and analyzed for natural infection of Dirofilaria from 4 different villages in the study area. The species composition of the collected mosquito specimens comprised 10 species belonging to 6 genera, namely Anopheles, Aedes, Armigeres, Culex, Uranotaenia, and Heizmannia. Aedes albopictus (Skuse, 1895) was found to be the predominant species, followed by Armigeres subalbatus Coquillett, 1898. Out of these, 200 female mosquitoes were grouped by species into 31 pools, for genomic DNA extraction. Detection of the nematode parasite was performed using nematode-specific primers via conventional PCR, and the species was subsequently confirmed by sanger sequencing. Natural-infection of Dirofilaria sp. “hongkongensis” was identified in Ae. albopictus and Ar. subalbatus, with a minimum infection rate of 17.6% and 13.3%, respectively. This study represents the first report of natural-infection of Dirofilaria sp. among field-collected mosquitoes in India. These findings underscore the need for robust entomological-surveillance system to prevent potential future outbreaks."

    "abstract": "In the 1990s, India's mediascape saw the efflorescence of edgy soft-porn films in the Malayalam-speaking state of Kerala. In Rated A, Darshana Sreedhar Mini examines the local and transnational influences that shaped Malayalam soft-porn cinema—such as vernacular pulp fiction, illustrated erotic tales, and American exploitation cinema—and maps the genre's circulation among blue-collar workers of the Indian diaspora in the Middle East, where pirated versions circulate alongside low-budget Bangladeshi films and Pakistani mujra dance films as South Asian pornography. Through a mix of archival and ethnographic research, Mini also explores the soft-porn industry's utilization of gendered labor and trust-based arrangements, as well as how actresses and production personnel who are marked by their involvement with a taboo form negotiate their social lives. By locating the tense negotiations between sexuality, import policy, and censorship in contemporary India, this study offers a model for understanding film genres outside of screen space, emphasizing that they constitute not just industrial formations but entire fields of social relations and gendered imaginaries."

    "abstract": "While large-scale land reform may still be underway in many countries, other contexts have states responding to land claims through scattered land provision measures. This article puts forward “landfare” as a lens to capture such measures and unpacks its features in one location. The article first explains this term, outlining its location in and departure from the land reform scholarship. It next shows how Kerala, India, widely cited in the scholarship for its 20th century land reform, addresses the land claims of its Adivasi citizens in the 21st century through landfare. Through an exploration of Adivasi land claims and an examination of state responses in Kerala, the article argues that landfare can work through four key modes—obfuscation, withholding available land, projectisation, and welfare fix. Unlike the “land-to-the-tiller” goals of 20th century land reform, 21st century landfare can be aimed at extinguishingland struggles."

    "abstract": "Kerala’s film industry or the Malayalam cinema is an excellent illustration of how regional films and film industries in India are evolving in response to changing socio-cultural values and audience expectations. Malayalam cinema has a complicated history of growth due to its conventional paternal system, as well as the similarly complex attitude towards the different social markers such as womanhood, caste hierarchy, relationships, actors, the language of representation, culture, race and off-screen interaction. \n\nThrough this research, the researcher offers a critical reading of contemporary Dalit lives in cinema by analysing three vernacular films, <i>Kismath</i>, <i>Trees Under the Sun</i> and <i>Pengalila</i>. The research adopts Bell Hooks’s theory of oppositional gaze as the theoretical framework for the study. The concept of an upper-caste superhero has been so ingrained in Malayali’s minds that they accept it as reality, and filmmakers of the previous decades made no effort to change it. \n\nThis article exposes the stereotyped depiction of the Dalit body and demonstrates how caste hierarchies are reproduced and shown through the social context of Kerala."

    "abstract": "This research aims to explore the adoption and usage pattern of neobanks in Kerala using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) incorporated with trust and demographic characteristics. Data were collected from 210 young adults aged 17–35 through an online questionnaire. Hypotheses developed were tested using non-parametric tests like Mann–Whitney U test and Kruskal–Wallis H test in SPSS for demographic variables and partial least square-structural equation modelling (SEM) for the remaining variables. The results indicate that behavioural intention (BI) significantly influences actual neobank usage, with perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (PEOU) that are crucial factors driving neobank acceptance. However, trust (T) does not significantly impact the BI to use neobanks among young customers but has a significant effect on PU. Additionally, gender emerges as significant demographic factor that affects neobank acceptance, while age, educational qualification, and occupation exhibit no significant effects. These insights help to identify key factors influencing neobank adoption, aiding in effective service expansion and business model development for neobanks. They also assist neobank managers in crafting marketing strategies that emphasize convenience and efficiency to attract and retain customers."

Originating in the latter part of the 16th century, today Kathakali commands attention and involves practitioners from around the world. Largely drawing its stories from the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, it integrates music, dance, grand makeup, and costume to evoke the epic universe. \n\nThis book illuminates how Kathakali combines associated literary texts, performative conventions, and practices from local and pan-Indian contexts. The actors use their whole body-deploying complex dance movements, interpretive gestures, and highly developed facial expressions-as a site to depict, elaborate, and interpret action. Encapsulating the world of Kathakali, its performative grammar, and the aesthetic theories that underpin it, this book examines its history as one of continual change.\n\nThe book traces the distinctive features of Kathakali, which is sometimes tightly structured with fixed conventions, and sometimes fluid enough to incorporate imaginative flights of fancy. It assesses Kathakali's cultural legacy and charts how the form has changed over the centuries. It also includes translations of extracts from poems, plays, and performance manuals, as well as interviews with actors and cultural historians."

This chapter delves into the complex relationship between humans and the moist deciduous forests of Western Ghats, Kerala, employing the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment framework to quantify the economic worth of services these ecosystems provide. Through detailed valuation procedures, the authors shed light on the hidden economic contribution of provisioning, regulating, cultural, and supporting services rendered by these vital ecosystems, facilitating informed decision-making on policies, alternatives, designing appropriate institutional and market (and non-market) instruments, and conservation tools like Payment for ecosystem services."

The study aims to explore all aspects related to the health of elderly tribal women. For the purpose of this study, elderly MTW are defined as individuals above 60 years of age. The quota sampling method is employed, along with other characteristics. This phenomenological study utilizes methods including group discussions, interviews, field observations and informal meetings. The experiences of the participants were collected through in-depth interviews, analysed thematically to identify common patterns and interpreted to understand their healthcare-seeking behaviours within their cultural context. The study found that 60% of women above 70 years of age used medicinal plants. Formal literacy was not found to be a determining factor in the usage of medicinal and traditional knowledge. Illiterate elderly women possess more knowledge about traditional herbal medicines than their literate counterparts."

The technical analyses suggest that site B has the most solar energy potential, while site C has the highest wind energy potential. However, the economic feasibility study reveals that the only suitable location is site B, which has a 10-year simple payback time (SPT). The site has an annual solar energy potential of 1633.85 kWh/kWp, which is enough to pump 3921.24 kL of water to irrigate the majority of crops in one acre."

Tangal spent most of his time critiquing the blurred boundaries of Western conceptions of religion, modernity, and secularism, in ways not unlike much later scholars such as Talal Asad and Saba Mahmoud. \n\nThe distinctiveness of Tangal’s approach was the construction of an alternative Islamic modernity that could take the place of Western Christian norms. Modernity, in Tangal’s eyes, was not a token of rationalism or secularism, but a tool for purifying Islam in Kerala from unwanted elements adopted from local cultures. This article also places Tangal’s thought against the backdrop of the theological and philosophical debate introduced to Kerala by the colonial administration between scholars who endorsed or rejected the European reconstruction of religion."

This study unveils the raw, visceral, and affective toll of migration on the ‘left-behind’ women in these regions. It examines Katthu Pattu (letter songs) from Malabar and Bidesiya Birha (Migrant Blues) from Bhojpur, two ethnocultural traditions, as affective discourses, reflecting spousal feelings of separation, intimacy, and marital ethics. The male authorship of these songs might seem to limit their insight into women’s emotions, yet they still provide multiple windows through which we can see the everyday emotional lives of left-behind women in postcolonial South Asia. These songs provide phenomenological depictions of women’s sorrow, pain, resilience, and spirit of endurance caused by separation and longing. We propose that diaspora songs from these two non-contiguous ethno-cultural regions demonstrate how left-behind women from South Asia share commonalities and incongruities."

I shall concentrate on a text compiled and written in the Malabar coast and examine how certain jurists in South Asia and the Middle East exchanged their ideas on the scribal and bibliophilic praxis of their time. \n\nThe rich scribal culture, with several language communities and manuscript traditions, of the maritime towns of Malabar arose from a constant mobility and consequent exchanges across the oceanic highway. This chapter concerns the Islamic materials written in Arabic and Arabic-Malayalam with a particular look at Ajwibat al-ʿajība by Zayn al-Dīn al-Malaybārī (d. in or after 1583), which provides insights into the bibliographical tradition among literati and jurists within their Islamic and multicultural contexts and their concepts of an ideal book culture. \n\nIn the text, various socio-political and religious norms can be seen to be intertwined with the etiquette and theories of writing and reading. I shall describe its rules on writing, disseminating, preserving, discarding, and objectifying books, and explore the prevalent notions and practices in the production and circulation of manuscripts in the region in the 16th century, identifying transregional, trans-temporal, and thematic implications."

    "abstract": "This article focuses on the narratives that emerged from two conversion episodes in Kerala in the 1920s involving the German missionary Paul Sengle (1870–1932): the conversion of a young Hindu woman named Kalyani and attempts to convert members of the Ezhava caste amid competition from Hindus, Muslims, and Buddhists. \n\nWhile mainly drawing on materials produced by the Basel Mission or by missionaries in the field like Sengle, this article also gives space to the perspectives of the newly converted person and of the rival religious communities. It suggests studying conversion experiences as shaped by situations of interaction, by connecting sources that represent the divergent perspectives of all the parties involved in such cases. \n\nThis approach helps to examine the different sides of a conversion experience at both macro and micro levels and offers insights into the broader processes of religious encounters in the early 20th century global history of religions."

    "abstract": "Russet-Coated Painted Ware (RCPW) is a distinctive ceramic ware found predominantly across the Deccan and southern regions of India. Noteworthy as one of the few painted ceramic wares in this region and for its presumed role as a chronological indicator of the Early Historic period, important questions about RCPW nevertheless remain. There is at present no complete accounting of the spatial distribution or chronological range of this ware, nor any understanding of patterns of production and possible exchange. While RCPW is generally viewed as a single type, its internal variability has likewise not been systematically documented. This article presents an overview of RCPW, examining its technical characteristics, chronological position, distribution patterns, and possible socio-cultural significance. Drawing upon existing archaeological evidence from the 4th-3rd centuries BCE to the Early Medieval period (circa 13–14 CE), this study begins to elucidate the origin and extent, production techniques, and morphology and decorative motifs of RCPW as a baseline for more advanced analysis. We trace the evolution of RCPW from its initial identification as ‘Andhra Ware’ by Wheeler in 1947 to its reclassification as Russet Coated Painted Ware by Thapar in 1957. Subsequent exploration and excavation efforts have expanded the geographical scope of RCPW's distribution, highlighting its presence in diverse regions such as Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Madhya Pradesh. This paper offers the most comprehensive spatial analysis of RCPW to date."

Serial nasopharyngeal swabs, feces, urine, and serum samples were collected on days 1, 7, 14, and 28. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with RNA positivity, viral clearance and seropositivity.\n\nResults: Among the index cases, median duration for respiratory samples to test negative was 10.5, 7 days in <18 and > 18 years respectively. The median period of RNA detection in feces was longer at 14 days (IQR 7, 28). The independent determinants of RT-PCR negativity of nasopharyngeal samples at >7 days was fever a OR 3.3 (95 % CI 1.1, 10.5). In the multivariable analysis for antibody response, those with less than or equal to 12 years of schooling had five times higher risk of being seronegative [aOR 5.2 (95 % CI 1.6, 16.7)]. Shedding of the virus in stool was more common among those aged <40 years (a OR 2.8, 95 % CI 1.2, 6.4) and among those who had fever (a OR 3.4, 95 % CI 1.1, 10.8). Among the contacts the seropositivity was determined by being illiterate 1.8 (95 % CI 1.1, 3.2), and reporting any symptom from day 1–14 aOR 3.2 (95 % CI 1.9, 5.2).\n\nConclusion: The shorter duration of RNA positivity in respiratory samples and viral shedding in stool has implications for managing infection control and monitoring in diverse populations."

Accordingly, various techniques have been deployed, such as sentiment and emotional analyses, topic modeling, and clustering methods. Key themes revealed from topic modeling were breakfast, facilities provided, ambience, bathroom, cleanliness, hospitality exhibited, and satisfaction with the host. A lasso logistic regression-based predictive binary text classification model (with 97.6% accuracy) for homestay recommendations was developed. Our findings and predictive model have implications for managers and homestay owners in devising appropriate marketing strategies and improving their overall guest experience."

By analysing three biographical sources, the paper explores how these narratives portray Ammal as an exemplary female scientist, specifically by formulating a rigid picture of an ‘ideal female scientist’. While elucidating the career and gender-specific challenges faced by Ammal as a female scientist, the paper employs the methodological framework of feminist science studies to explore the creation, dissemination, and attribution of specific subjectivities. It examines how class, gender, and caste in India affected Ammal’s scientific career. Moreover, these biographies shed light on the role played by race in her scientific pursuits in nineteenth-century British India."

    "abstract": "In contrast to their career in the rest of India, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI (M)] continue to thrive as a highly successful electoral and cultural force in Kerala. Popularly known as the ‘Party’, an important aspect of CPI(M) has been its populist streak even though its official discourse is one that strongly adheres to rule-based reasoning by prioritising ideological principles in its policies and decisions. \n\nThe populist streak often manifests through myths and cultic adoration built around its leaders as well as through the occasional branding of Indian judiciary and democracy as bourgeois. It is further characterised by a strong ‘us vs. them’ rhetoric in which the ‘them’ is a powerful other, variously identified as CIA (Central Intelligence Agency of the US), or the media syndicate, or the government of the Indian Union, etc. \n\nUsually, the Communist Party is studied only with reference to its history and policies, and it has seldom been interrogated on the affective energies it generates in the everyday. This paper proposes to discuss communist iconography, such as portraits of yesteryear leaders circulated via social media and displayed in communist family homes, as sites where affective energies are generated and realised. \n\nTaking its cue from Christopher Pinney’s corpothetics, the paper intends to study this visual practice as an embodied aesthetic engagement, which by invoking filial sentiments, renders the Party felt for its supporters. By drawing on the concept of darshan, the ritualistic and devotional viewing of deities, the paper endeavours to place the affectivity of these portraits in a broader cultural milieu."

    "abstract": "This study proposes a framework for understanding Sufi romance literature, the Badrulmunīr ḥusnuljamāl (The Tale of Badr ul-Munīr and Ḥusn ul-Jamāl, referred to as BMHJ) from the context of its circulation in early modern Malabar. The composition and reception of this romance marks a watershed moment in the literary history of Malabar as it holds the status of being the first Muslim romance written in the literary register of Arabi-Malayalam (we use the term Arabi-Malayalam to denote the distinct literary register that developed by the early modern literati in Tamil Nadu and Malabar. We are not using the above nomenclatures to invoke the usage of the Arabic scripts employed to write down their literary registers). There have been few scholarly attempts to locate the text in the wider context of the circulation of Persianate literature in Southern India in the last century of Persian in South Asia. The scholarly investigations to locate the ‘authentic’ Persian/Persianate original of BMHJ have often ended at Mīr Ḥasan’s Siḥr ul-bayān (The Sorcery of Expression), an Urdu mathnawī composed during the late eighteenth century. This study, for the first time, identifies BMHJ’s thematic and ideological affinity with the wider genre of Hindavi Sufi romance literature that was composed and canonized between the fourteenth and the sixteenth centuries in Hindustan (North India). To historicize the production of BMHJ as a Persianate Sufi romance-mathnawī garbed in Arabi-Malayalam poetics, this article reconstructs the circulatory regime of Persianate literature in Malabar at the takiyya (Sufi lodge) of Khwāja Muḥammad Shāh (d. 1767) in Koṇṭōṭṭi. We argue that the composition of BMHJ was a conscious effort from the takiyya to spread the Qādirī-Chishtī ṭarīqa (Sufi order) in Malabar through the popularization of Sufi romance literature at a particular historical moment of ṭarīqa contestation."

    "abstract": "This study assessed the role of land rights, particularly under the Forest Rights Act (FRA) 2006, in empowering tribal women in Kerala, India. The analysis highlighted the crucial role of land as a fundamental resource for subsistence, social status, and identity in tribal communities, emphasizing that women's land rights boosted productivity and empowerment, thereby advancing gender equality. The FRA 2006, which ensured land rights, resource access, and conservation responsibilities for tribal communities, included provisions specifically aimed at empowering women through joint titles and participation in decision-making processes. The study used both primary and secondary data to assess the economic, social, and political dimensions of empowerment among tribal women beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries of the FRA. It employed a comprehensive framework to measure empowerment across various domains, such as autonomy in agricultural production, household facilities, mobility, self-confidence, public participation, and decision-making. The findings indicated that while the FRA contributed to some degree of empowerment, particularly in terms of political participation and freedom of choice, significant challenges remained, including limited economic gains and persistent patriarchal norms that restricted women's decision-making power and mobility. The results highlighted the complex interplay between land rights and women's empowerment, revealing that while land ownership improved certain aspects of women's lives, it did not fully transform their status or alleviate the burdens of household responsibilities. The study found that legal reforms like the FRA can significantly enhance empowerment, but their success depends on addressing structural and cultural barriers, as well as providing comprehensive support in multiple domains. These insights contribute to the broader discourse on empowerment by highlighting the need for intersectional and multi-dimensional approaches to achieve sustainable development."

    "abstract": "Analysis of the influence of changes in land use on the sediment yield from watersheds provides crucial inputs that aid the development of appropriate strategies for the sustainable management of consequent land degradation. Event-based hydrologic models can be used for performing such analysis, as long-term hydrological datasets are not available for most of the rivers in developing countries like India. In this study, an event-based Two-Dimensional Runoff, Erosion, and Export (TREX) model was used to simulate the soil erosion process in Moozhy, an ungauged watershed in the Karamana River basin in Thiruvananthapuram District, Kerala State, India. Rainfall, streamflow, and sediment concentration data corresponding to three isolated storm events were used to calibrate and validate the model. The performance of the model was assessed using four statistical measures, namely, Percent bias (PBIAS), Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency Coefficient (NSEC), Coefficient of determination (R2) and RMSE-observations standard deviation ratio (RSR). The values of PBIAS varied between 46% and 49%, indicating satisfactory performance of the model. Also, from the values of NSEC and RSR, it can be concluded that the TREX model yields acceptable results. For a rainfall event that occurred on the 17 September 2017, the simulated values showed that about 1054 t of suspended sediments are transported from the watershed to the stream channels, and about 1020 t is carried out of the Moozhy watershed. Only a very small amount of sediment is left in the channel at the end of the simulation. About 34 t of sediment is deposited in the channel bed, about 0.04 t remains in suspension, and the balance 0.04 t remains in suspension as a suspended load. About 3% of the total sediment entering the reach of the stream considered in this study is deposited on the riverbed. The major component of the settled sediments is silt; about 12% of the total silt size fraction entering the stream settles on the river bed. Future scenarios of land use in the watershed were modelled using a hybrid Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Cellular Automata (CA) model. These were used for simulating sediment discharge using the TREX erosion model. The predicted land use scenarios were used to investigate both short-term (2025 and 2029) and long-term (2037, 2045, and 2053) variations in sediment discharge. The sediment yield for the storm event that occurred on 17 September 2017 was used to benchmark the variation in sediment yield under the predicted land use scenarios. Results indicate that the peak runoff and the runoff volume are expected to increase by about 29% and 22% respectively in the period from 2005 to 2053. The expected increase in the volume of sediments in this period is about 50%; the peak sediment concentration is likely to increase by about 56%. The study highlights the threats of likely increase in soil erosion and consequent land degradation posed by unscientific changes in land use caused by urbanisation and calls for proper management interventions to address the problem."

    "abstract": "This study tries to review the land use policies from the perspective of their impact on the ecosystem and identify significant negative LULC changes and their spatial distribution. The study proposes a decision support system to evaluate land-use policies based on the coupling coordination degree (CCD) of LULC and water-related ecosystem service (WES) changes. By studying the nature of the interaction, changes in the intensity and significance of land use and land cover (LULC) changes with negative WES changes, the implications of the government LULC policies and schemes are assessed. Unlike general LULC-WES studies that focus on the influence of the LULC on WES in a cross-section of time, this study focuses on the changes in the WES due to changes in LULC over the longitudinal section of time at pixel-level resolution. For illustration, one of the fastest urbanizing districts in Kerala, Kozhikode, was selected. From 2003 to 2013, LULC-driven WES changes were highest in municipal areas and the western coast, shifting to midlands and urban centers in 2013–2022. Critical land use changes included the conversion of plantations and farms to built-up areas (2003-2013), and plantations to farms and barren lands (2013–2022). The 2018 Kerala Forest Policy effectively reduced forest conversion, while several agricultural and conservation policies proved ineffective. Key ecological concerns include farm-to-urban conversion and plantation abandonment in urbanizing areas. The study emphasizes the need for targeted, ecologically informed agricultural policies to address these issues and improve WES management. The spatial mapping of LULC changes hotspots that are detrimental to WES and assists urban decision-makers in the formulation of decentralized, participatory, and spatially targeted land use controls."

The paper introduces the concept of agonistic reconciliation as a helpful way forward. The paper concludes by saying that in such scenarios, while intervention from locally grounded third parties may help achieve negative peace, more substantive change can come if there is a rethinking and transformative re-imagination within each community."

    "abstract": "In March 2000, Coca Cola, under its Indian subsidiary Hindustan Coca-Cola Beverages Private Limited (HCCBPL), established a bottling plant at Plachimada, a small village in the Perumatty panchayat, located in the Palakkad district of Kerala, India. After two years of manufacturing cola products in Plachimada, the extensive extraction of groundwater for the production facility and the improper disposal of waste started to negatively impact the local environment. This led to environmental injustice, toxicity, a shortage of drinking water, and related environmental issues. Under these conditions, the local population, particularly the tribal individuals residing closest to the plant, resisted seeking justice, and Mayilamma, a tribal woman of the Eravallar community, spearheaded the movement. Within this framework, the article focusses on Mayilamma’s autobiography, Mayilamma: The Life of a Tribal Eco-Warrior, as a means to illustrate the Plachimada struggle, the detrimental impacts of capitalism and developmentalism, the injustices faced by tribal communities, and their response to these challenges. In doing so, the article highlights the importance of grassroots activism and environmentalism of the poor, employing Mayilamma’s narrative as a springboard."

    "abstract": "Carbon stock options to mitigate climate change have become a significant area of interest as every possible way to address this global issue is being explored. Afforestation and ecosystem restoration activities are widely adopted to improve the potential of the land in carbon storage. The Kerala State Action Plan on Climate Change proposed the ‘Trees outside forests (Tof)’ as an effective mechanism to mitigate climate change. Due to its discrete distribution and non-uniformity, there are fewer attempts to measure the potential of these systems. Palakkad district of Kerala has a discrete climate due to the Palaghat gap and the absence of a coastal line. The district also has a major population depending on agriculture. This study tried to determine and compare the carbon (C) stock potential of the three ‘Trees outside forest (Tof)’ conditions prevailing in the Palakkad district, Kerala. The carbon stock by standing biomass and soil of four sites of undisturbed natural vegetation, monoculture plantation, and home garden were estimated using allometric equations and computations. The natural vegetation was found to have a higher carbon stock potential (238.58 Mg ha−1) compared with monoculture plantation (166.23 Mg ha−1) and human habitat (74.87 Mg ha−1). Also, natural vegetation's soil organic carbon content was much higher than monoculture plantations and home gardens. The study also estimated the soil deterioration index of each land use compared with the natural vegetation and barren land. The results of the study suggested that land use has a great influence on soil quality and carbon stock potential. Proper management of these Tof systems can enhance their productivity and contribute accountable support towards mitigating climate change."

    "abstract": "This paper examines dowry deaths and related domestic violence through case studies, focusing on the role of public responses analysed through the prism of the nattukar—the local crowd of observers. It explores the dynamics of public outcry and interrogates critical questions surrounding women's liberatory politics. The paper argues that while these public outcries have led to the articulation of needs within various discursive arenas, including legal and administrative responses, they remain limited in fostering a collective conscience or advancing politicised demands that reject dowry practices and advocate for transformative changes to the structures that enable violence."

    "abstract": "The narrative approach to city writing in the postcolonial world gravitates towards metropolitan spaces. The discourse around how these cities are imagined and theorized uses reference points from modernity. With the emergence of the spatial turn in literary theory and criticism, this discourse borrows from Western, postmodern sensibilities to define cities and their narrative possibilities. In contrast to these sensibilities, regional variations of practising narrative geography that are non-Western and pre-modern reveal a heightened sense of territorial consciousness and a claim towards mythological origins posing as history. One of these genres is that of the pre-modern genre of the sthala purana from India. This article seeks to foreground it as a geographical narrative of individual locales within India. We argue that it is a genre that opens up fascinating possibilities for the exploration of cities outside postcolonial metropolises so that such spaces can be understood on their own terms rather than being compared to the big city as if it were a paradigm. We focus on one Kochi (a city in Kerala) novel by Sethu, The Saga of Muziris to explicate the knowledge-making about cities at work in such narrative geography in the way it invokes Kochi’s ancestor of the ancient port city of Muziris."

    "abstract": "The study has evolved in response to the challenges posed by climate change and rapid urbanization occurring worldwide, which contribute to an increased frequency of natural disasters. It addresses flood hazards in Kerala’s Nilambur urban area, where climate change and rapid urbanization heighten disaster risk. Kerala's coastal location and steep terrain in the Western Ghats increase vulnerability, particularly as one of India’s most densely populated states. The research identifies flood risk zones applying overlay analysis, using data from the 2018 Kerala Floods, to create a flood risk framework responsive to runoff volume and thereby flood susceptibility. Key factors include climatic variables, terrain characteristics like elevation, slope, soil, land-use land-cover including urban density, and hydrological and ecological elements like stream networks and floodplains. These are integrated in the SWAT tool to model flood risks, creating a resilient flood risk assessment framework that combines hydrological and ecological parameters."

    "abstract": "Background Much data informing sex differences in atrial fibrillation (AF) comes from Western cohorts. In this analysis, we describe sex differences in Kerala, India, using the Kerala-AF registry—the largest AF registry from the Indian subcontinent. Methods Patients aged ≥18 years were recruited from 53 hospitals across Kerala. Patients were compared for demographics, treatments, and 12-month outcomes, including major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and bleeding. Results Male patients were more likely to have a smoking and/or alcohol history and had more ischaemic heart disease (46.2% vs. 25.5%; p < 0.001). Female patients had more valvular AF (35.1% vs. 18.0%; p < 0.001), and more use of calcium-channel blockers (23.3% vs. 16.5%; p < 0.001) or digoxin (39.6% vs. 28.5%; p < 0.001). Almost one in four patients were not anticoagulated despite raised CHA2DS2-VASc scores. 12-month MACE outcomes did not differ by sex (male: 30.2% vs. female: 29.4%; p = 0.685), though bleeding events were more common in male patients (2.4% vs. 1.3%; p = −0.038), driven by minor bleeding (1.2% vs. 0.5%). Conclusion In this large AF cohort from India, male patients had a higher prevalence of ischaemic heart disease, smoking, and alcohol use, while female patients had a higher prevalence of valvular heart disease. MACE did not differ by sex, though bleeding was more common in males. Almost a quarter of patients were not anticoagulated despite raised thromboembolic risk."

    "abstract": "Theyyam is an old socio-religious ritual from North Kerala that has been practised in different parts of Malabar for a very long time, particularly by certain castes or tribes such as Malaya, Pulaya, Thiyya, Vannan, etc. It is a type of worship in which a common man assumes the role of a god and engages in a ritualistic dance and the performance is meant to benefit the society by bringing wealth and prosperity. Theyyam has experienced many transformations and been incorporated into the social order. This article uses a few chosen materials that include Malayalam short films and album tracks (Neeli, Varav, Kaavakam, and Pambichi) which portray the traditional folk form Theyyam. The convergence of gender performativity and counter-hegemony in the portrayal of Theyyam as a traditional folk art is the focus of this research article. This study examines how social power dynamics, gender issues, and caste conflict are interwoven with Theyyam through an analysis of the selected discourses. It demonstrates the ways in which alternate gender role presentations have been a part of subaltern opposition to dominant caste authority through the employment of Theyyam. The paper also explores how popular culture absorbed and exalted the powerful Theyyam, revealing the intricacies of its portrayal and possibly exposing societal hypocrisies."

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the livelihoods, health, pay disparity and well-being of women workers in the unorganised sector, particularly in fields such as agriculture, fisheries and handloom. These women are especially vulnerable to exploitation, gender inequality and human rights violations, as they lack institutional support welfare measures and are poorly organised. The pandemic has only worsened their situation. A field survey was conducted using structured questionnaires with 769 women workers from five districts in Tamil Nadu and Kerala states of India to understand the magnitude and different dimensions of their experiences related to pay disparity and health during pandemic times. The study was conducted after both waves of COVID-19. The study focuses on their livelihoods, health, pay disparity, well-being, working conditions, household dynamics, health scenarios and authorities’ support during the pandemic. The data were supplemented with qualitative inputs with in-depth interviews with women workers across these districts. The results indicate that pay disparity and livelihoods were significant issues faced by women workers during the pandemic, along with financial difficulties, health issues and increased workloads. 84.65 per cent of women workers are aware of wage discrimination, while 48 per cent reported pay disparity at their workplace, 78 per cent were unpaid for overtime, and 88 per cent worked without training or safety measures. However, it was found that 99.7 per cent of women workers had been vaccinated. Based on the study results, there is an urgent need for national and state-level policies and support specifically aimed at women workers in the unorganised sector in India. Failure to address these issues will result in ongoing problems related to pay inequality, poverty, health risks and social marginalisation."

    "abstract": "This article analyses NT translation in the Indian context with a focus on John 10.1–18 in the <I>Satya Veda Pusthakam</i> (SVP), a Malayalam version of the Bible. The colonial context in which this translation was produced is first outlined, showing how this context and its accompanying ideology shaped approaches to translation. This led to a translation that does not reflect the culture or language of subaltern communities, but reinforces dominant class ideology in its adoption of English and Sanskritised style. These issues are illustrated through a closer analysis of John 10.1–18 in the SVP. Finally, the essay explores the ways in which translation can enable communication between cultures, and argues for a decolonised approach to biblical translation in the Indian context. The challenge of decolonisation might continue to reshape NT studies in India as the indigenous and subaltern communities get involved in Bible translation and interpretation of the text."

The early history of the Nampūtiri monastic centres of Kerala still remains very much obscure. This article aims to fill the lacuna and propose a working hypothesis of order in question, tracing its sources to the local institution of a ‘temple saṃnyāsin’, referred to in the Keralan epigraphs as bhaṭāra-tiruvaṭi or paḻāra-tiruvaṭi. In order to reconstruct the early history of the local monastic tradition, I focus primarily on the available inscriptional material, which I discuss at length in the latter part of the article, that follows the elaborate description of the vernacular sampradāya based on the ethnographic material, constituting foundation for integrating the epigraphic evidence."

But how do they respond to unfavourable external events? Through netnographic analysis of a select Christian Facebook page, this study explores the community’s framing of Manipur violence, which was characterised as Christian persecution within a majoritarian setting. The research probes the frame-building process, simplifying historical intricacies and reframing ethnic violence and tribal strife within the narrative. The analysis reveals the adoption of caste consciousness and the religious othering tropes to undermine the solidarity extended to Manipur Christians. The formats of multimedia content and the linguistic choices exemplify the rhetorical positioning of the community. The findings shed insights into the deliberations of minorities within and outside their communities in a majoritarian framework."

In the Indian context, competitive federalism has amplified the pull factors that attract migrants to new destinations. While Maharashtra, Delhi and Gujarat continue to attract large interstate migration, new corridors are emerging in traditionally less migrant-reliant regions. This study explores how destination location attributes influence migrant workers’ choices when they have multiple options for destination places. \n\nUsing primary data from Surat in Gujarat and Kochi in Kerala, we offer a comparative analysis employing exploratory factor analysis and qualitative methods to examine key destination attributes. \n\nThe findings reveal that Gujarat attracts migrants primarily for its abundant job opportunities and ease of employment, whereas Kerala attracts migrant labour with higher wages. These variations stem from the distinct demographics, economic structures and cultural contexts of Surat and Kochi."

Compliance in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is largely unknown.We prospectively evaluated 2928 STEMI patients in Kerala, India, across 16 PCI-capable hospitals who received reperfusion with either primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) or fibrinolysis. Primary endpoint was a major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) composite of death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke or readmission for heart failure at 1-year.Among reperfused STEMI patients, 320 (10.9%) received timely reperfusion with either PPCI or fibrinolysis, 1985 (67.8%) received delayed PPCI, and 623 (21.3%) received delayed fibrinolysis. Timely reperfusion had lower unadjusted MACE rates than delayed PCI or fibrinolysis (timely reperfusion: 11.9%, delayed PPCI: 13.6%, delayed fibrinolysis: 23.9%, P &lt; 0.001). Mortality was lowest in the timely reperfusion group (timely reperfusion: 6.3%, delayed PPCI: 7.8%, delayed fibrinolysis 18.8%, P &lt; 0.001). After multivariate analysis, delayed fibrinolysis had a higher MACE rate (HR 1.52 95% CI 1.04–2.21) and mortality (HR 1.97, 95% CI 1.18–3.25) compared to timely reperfusion. Total ischemic time &gt; 3 h and delayed first medical contact-to-needle time predicted MACE at 1 year.Among STEMI patients in Kerala, India, only one in 10 eligible patients received timely reperfusion. Longer total ischemic times and delayed fibrinolysis were associated with 1-year MACE. Improving timely reperfusion is critical to enhancing STEMI outcomes in LMICs.Given the established link between delay to reperfusion and worse major adverse cardiac events (MACE), global efforts have concentrated on minimizing different components of the total ischemic time to improve ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) outcomes.Compliance in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is largely unknown.In this cohort of STEMI patients in Kerala, India, total ischemic time and first medical contact-to-needle time correlated with long-term MACE rates, whereas other timeliness indicators did not.Our study highlights the significant barriers to accessing STEMI care that are prevalent in LMICs despite incremental growth in the number of PCI-capable hospitals.The pre-hospital phase within total ischemic time is the most important quality improvement metric of STEMI care in LMICs, especially for patients chosen for fibrinolysis."

Attempting to control pepper-growing areas such as the Malabar Coast (south-western coast of India) was part of this plan. Calicut was an important port city in Malabar and a vital player in the Indian Ocean trade. Unlike many port cities that were controlled by the European companies, the rulers and merchants of Calicut attempted to sustain a free trading port on their own instead of accepting a European company monopoly. In short, Calicut offered an alternative emporium for Indian Ocean trade in Malabar by resisting imperial endeavours.

    "abstract": "Happiness has been shown to influence many health-related outcomes in older adults. Identifying correlates and brain substrates of happiness across countries and cultures is an important goal, as the global older adult population continues to increase.We used univariate and multiple regression to examine associations between happiness and several demographic, health, and lifestyle variables in 665 older adults (39% female) from Kerala, India. We also used Bayesian regression to examine associations between cortical thickness and happiness in a subsample of 188 participants that completed MRI scanning.Happiness was significantly associated with several variables. In our multiple regression model, which included all significant univariate predictors, self-rated health, depression, anxiety, apathy, social network size, social network diversity, and social support significantly predicted happiness. Demographic indicators (age, sex, education, marital status, residence, and employment status/type), cognitive impairment, comorbidities, and leisure activities were not significantly associated with happiness in the multiple regression model. Cortical thickness in several brain regions was positively associated with happiness scores, including frontal, temporal, parietal, occipital, and cingulate regions.Understanding the key correlates is critical for identifying both modifiable factors that can be targeted in well-being interventions and fixed characteristics that identify those at-risk for reduced happiness. The widespread pattern of brain regions associated with happiness is consistent with the multifactorial nature of happiness and, given that the regions identified do not overlap with those vulnerable to cortical thinning, can help explain why subjective well-being, unlike other cognitive functions, is largely resistant to age-related decline."

    "abstract": "Domestic work is emerging as one of the fastest-growing informal sectors; gendered stereotypes coupled with low economic value attached to this sector affect the working conditions and quality of life of women engaged in domestic work. Using data collection methods such as scheduled questionnaire surveys and focus group discussions, information was collected from 600 participants from three states: Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Mizoram (200 from each). Participants were chosen using the simple random method from the lists provided by the NGOs from cities such as Kochi and Trivandrum (Kerala), Chennai and Trichy (Tamil Nadu) and Aizawl (Mizoram). Data were collected from May 2021 to August 2021. The findings of this study show that the majority of the domestic workers under study experience problems such as poor working conditions, workplace harassment and discrimination at different levels. The realisation that the demand for domestic workers is on the rise, especially in urban India, and the fact that more and more families report the need for such workers prompts us to recognise that it is time to regulate the sector and ensure decent working conditions. Enforcement of decent working conditions and labour rights is essential to ensure that both employers and workers understand the worth and importance of domestic work. The regulation and formalisation of domestic work should be in the interests of both workers and employers because the stakeholders’ rights, responsibilities and liabilities will be well defined, which ultimately will facilitate improving the quality of life for both."

    "abstract": "Ecological and political instability have time and again emerged as catalysts for risky development projects along India's south-west coastline. Devika Shankar probes this complicated relationship between crisis and development through a focus on a port development project executed in Cochin in the first quarter of the twentieth century amidst significant political and ecological uncertainty. While ecological concerns were triggered by increasing coastal erosion, a political crisis was precipitated by a neighbouring princely state's unprecedented attempt to extend its sovereignty over the British port. This integrative environmental, legal, and political history brings together the history of British India and the princely states to show how these anxieties ultimately paved the way for an ambitious port development project in the final years of colonial rule. In the process it deepens our understanding of environmental transformations and development in modern South Asia and the uneven nature of colonial sovereignty."

This language is apparent across denominational agencies and geographical locations. I will demonstrate that it was a particularly strong motivating factor in the Church Missionary Society’s ”Mission of Help” to the Syrian Christians of Travancore. Yet a combination of ecclesiastical and political factors served to thwart this mission endeavor and raises abiding questions regarding the usefulness of such language in mission motivation."

    "abstract": "The demography of Indian cities has witnessed rapid pace of urbanisation in its nature and content. The census has shown an alarming acceleration of the incidence of urban growth rate ever in the history of India, i.e., urban population in India is growing at a higher pace than the growth rate of its total population. Obviously, there is uneven distribution of urban population in India, in which south India possesses the highest urban populace than central and north India. The south Indian state of Kerala is also witnessing a rapid level of urbanisation, with more than 47% of its population living in urban areas. The state registered its highest level of urbanisation during the last decade (2010–2020), with a growth rate of 92.72%. If the pace of urbanisation continues like this, Kerala will become 100% urban in the future. The high rate of urbanisation is building pressure on the government to provide necessary services to the rapidly expanding and concentrated population. Urban Kerala also faces multiple challenges in raising infrastructure, governance, and delivery of services. These issues shall be tackled by city governments that have pivotal roles to play. But city governments are functioning in a highly restrictive environment. The autonomy they experience in a functional system is insufficient to deliver sophisticated urban services. Proliferation of parastatal organisations duplicates the functions of city governance. At present, functional autonomy gets questioned by over-dependence on state and central government agencies, and this may lead to a potential compromise in decision-making. At this juncture, the doctrine of minimum government structures and maximum governance systems has its importance. This chapter seeks to examine prospects and challenges of functional autonomy in urban local governance in Kerala, in the context of rapid urbanisation, and also highlights the constrained autonomy of urban local government institutions in Kerala, with a call for a more streamlined and efficient governance structure to meet the challenges posed by rapid urbanisation."

    "abstract": "This chapter explores the vibrant landscape of language initiatives within the Indian community in Singapore, which encompasses 11 linguistic subgroups that speak distinct languages such as Tamil, Malayalam, Telugu, Kannada, Hindi and other minority Indian languages. The research methodology comprises a qualitative approach, utilising online interviews as the primary data collection method due to the constraints imposed by the Covid-19 pandemic. Complementing the interviews, documentary materials such as digital newsletters, newspapers, and magazines produced within the communities serve as valuable sources of insight. The findings reveal a nuanced portrait of how the three South Indian minority language communities navigate the absence of institutional support in Singapore to champion the reading and writing of their respective languages. The discussion revolves around two pivotal approaches—community-run initiatives and the strategic utilisation of technology. Within the realm of community-run initiatives, this study uncovers the significance of community-run language classes, community events, and platforms that provide opportunities for individuals to engage in reading and writing activities. These initiatives serve as vital conduits for fostering language preservation and engagement."

    "abstract": "While Kerala is widely recognised as a pioneer in advancing gender equality, particularly within the realm of education, several studies have drawn attention to the potential reinforcement of patriarchal norms and values within the state’s educational system. Students’ study materials are one of how such value transmission takes place. Gender-specific roles are often normalised through children’s textbooks, and in the long run, it results in the gender division of labour in society. As it has the greatest potential to transform society by breaking stereotypes like that of gender, the study materials have to be carefully formulated in this direction. Hence, an in-depth analysis of the textbooks regarding the gender dynamics they present is very relevant. In this context, the present study attempts to understand how the gender dimensions of household work, the most debated aspect of gender issues, are presented in Kerala’s State Council for Educational Research and Training school textbooks. The study aims to determine whether these textbooks are perpetuating patriarchal norms of household work or whether any attempts to challenge these norms exist. The study employs the content analysis of primary school textbooks, first to the seventh standard. The findings will help modify school textbooks’ contents in a gender-sensitive manner."

    "abstract": "This chapter explores the multifaceted experiences of transgender individuals in Kerala, shedding light on the challenges and successes within the context of the Transgender Policy implemented in 2015. Transgender people, encompassing those whose gender identity deviates from their assigned sex at birth, face a complex journey in reconciling their true selves with societal expectations. The Transgender Policy, a pioneering initiative in India following a 2014 Supreme Court judgement, aimed to address the rights and welfare of this community. While some conform to societal norms, others grapple with identity conflicts, leading to isolation and potential vulnerability. Kerala’s commitment to gender mainstreaming through policies is acknowledged, yet the chapter raises the crucial question of translating these policies into tangible development outcomes. The first part critically examines the Transgender Policy and its implementation status, drawing insights from secondary sources. It seeks to understand the state’s approach and evaluate the impact of policies on shaping discourses around gender identity. The second part, supported by empirical evidence, delves into the challenges faced by transgender individuals in Kerala. From cultural divergence to educational barriers, the chapter explores how some overcome adversity with courage, living authentically, while others may resort to survival mechanisms such as prostitution or begging due to limited opportunities. This comprehensive exploration aims to contribute to the ongoing dialogue on transgender rights and welfare, evaluating the effectiveness of policies and identifying areas for further improvement in ensuring inclusivity and equal opportunities for the transgender community in Kerala."

Problematising the question of gender paradox within the dystopian picture of the developmental trajectory of the region, christened as the ‘Kerala Model of Development’, the chapter embarks on a sociological enquiry into feminine subjectivity within a gendered regime. Nayar matriliny in Kerala originally gave rise to a woman-centric socio-cultural milieu within the prevailing caste and cultural matrix. Cultural elements such as customs, rituals, and festivals further contributed to ascertaining and celebrating feminine powers and autonomy and building gender relations equitably. The chapter, employing an ethnographic gaze into this cultural matrix of the matrilineal tradition, endeavours to recapture the nature–culture continuum to redefine women’s position that was ruptured by colonial modernity."

While gender imbalances in scientific participation and professional outcomes have been extensively studied, the specific context of Kerala provides a unique lens into this phenomenon, expanding the discourse beyond the well-researched territories of the United States and Western Europe. This research contributes valuable insights to the broader global conversation on gender equality in academia, shedding light on the nuanced challenges faced by scientists in a diverse cultural and geographical setting."

    "abstract": "Usually, toxic colonialism is being observed in a global perspective where industrial waste containing highly toxic substances is being exported from developed countries to poor countries for disposal in exchange for money. This transfer of hazardous waste from developed countries to developing and underdeveloped countries occurs due to three main reasons: rising cost for disposal in developed countries, strict protocols being imposed by the respective governments, and rising native resistance against setting up of landfills In 1989, the Basel Convention came into existence to curb this kind of cross-border exploitation through toxic waste migration. Still, similar actions are observable from Western countries towards West Africa, South Asia, and China. Nevertheless, a comparable global scenario is evident at the local level, where waste from cities is transported to the outskirts or villages for disposal or landfilling. This waste transfer practice is observed in cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, and virtually all urban centres across India A clear instance of such a waste movement from cities to villages has been observed in Thiruvananthapuram, the capital city of Kerala. Vilappilsala, located on the outskirts of Thiruvananthapuram city, has experienced severe social and environmental repercussions due to the migration of municipal waste from Thiruvananthapuram Municipal Corporation (TMC). The chapter examines the adverse socioeconomic and environmental consequences stemming from the centralised municipal solid waste treatment plant commissioned by TMC in the small village community of Vilappilsala."

    "abstract": "The Indian communist movement made a comparatively limited contribution to the expansion of the theoretical framework of Marxism, especially in contrast to the substantial contributions made by the former USSR, China, Cuba, Vietnam, and the communist nations in Latin America. However, the Indian communist endeavour has registered notable developmental accomplishments in certain regions of the country, particularly in advancing the interests of the working class. An analysis of communist developmental strategies in Kerala and the role of E.M.S. Namboodiripad as a pragmatic visionary in its guidance assumes prominence within this context. Namboodiripad wielded substantial influence in moulding the developmental trajectory of the state of Kerala subsequent to its formation. This chapter seeks to outline the historical trajectory and political ethos of the communist movement in Kerala, with a particular emphasis on the ideology of Communism, predominantly drawing insights from Namboodiripad’s political writings and autobiography. In this process, the making and transformation of Namboodiripad as a leader and theoretician, the rapidly varying political scenario before and after Indian independence, and the role played by communist parties of Russia and China form crucial variables. This chapter also presents an understanding of Namboodiripad’s line of thought on the relation between parliamentary modes of political activity and the communist movement in the region."

    "tags": "Sociology & Anthropology",
    "abstract": "The chapter intends to bring forth a site-specific process of gendering labour, locating women’s assertion to recognise their labour and human dignity. It is based on an instance of social movement that burst out in the hilly tracts of Munnar plantations by a group of women tea plantation workers arguing for 20% bonus and other benefits. Depending primarily on workers’ union led by male trade union workers and their leaders, the women workers’ demands and needs were not activated and articulated by conventional working-class movements. As a reaction to the disillusionment of not being represented well by the male workers’ movement, women workers tried to amplify their demand by organising themselves, popularly known as penpillei orumai, i.e., all women unite. Though this was an extemporised outcry, women took the leadership to fight for their rights against male labour unions’ inabilities to represent women’s concerns. They allege that the capital–state nexus in continually reducing their wages and bonus is due to the insensitivity of trade unions ruled by male leaders. The movement shed light on the specific identity-based question before the trade unions and management of the tea plantations. However, a hope of spark that broke the ground was stalled by the capital–state–male trio; it is depicted as a stalled revolution from the peripheries."

The state of widowhood has a coercive structural effect on the lives of widows to follow customary practices and, as a result, keep their subjectivity low. This chapter seeks to explore the voices of the widows that were hitherto invisibilised by age-old social and cultural practices. Against the culture of silence, this study unmasks the factors that led to silence the subjectivity and experience of hardship of a coercive identity. A field-based survey conducted across Kerala unveils the hard battles that the widows fought. Other than being subjected to isolation, social suffering, and psychological trauma, widows comply with restrictions on choices and aspirations to conduct a meaningful life. The inner voices on the assertion of these subjects are often unheard but are critical for cultural transformation and development."

    "abstract": "Under the direction of local self-government, the Kerala state government initiated the Kudumbashree project in 1998. It has successfully changed the lives of over 46 lakh women and their families in Kerala after 25 years of operation. Kudumbashree, India’s biggest women’s network, played a crucial role in empowering women in the state. The socioeconomic condition of women determines the development of society. The Kudumbashree programme’s neighbourhood groups changed many women’s lives over time, profoundly altering Kerala society in the process. The Kudumbashree programme tackled women’s financial and nonfinancial concerns while responding to local needs and making use of local resources. The different Kudumbashree programmes that the Kerala government has launched are examined in this chapter. ‘Reaching out to families through women and reaching out to the community through families’ is the motto of Kudumbashree Mission. Participatory planning and implementation at the local level enable impoverished women to achieve financial empowerment through the thrift and credit programmes of Kudumbashree neighbourhood groups. Women and their families now enjoy higher living standards due to economic development. This chapter focuses on the factors that lead to the sustainable approaches of the Kudumbashree project. Initiatives of women empowerment, microfinance operations, micro-enterprises, and community action contribute to the core activities of Kudumbashree. The Kudumbashree project aims to elevate women’s status in society through their overall empowerment. According to the study, women’s socioeconomic development and living conditions are directly impacted by the Kudumbashree project."

    "abstract": "This chapter delves into the profound influence of mass media on the lives of tribal women in Kerala. The study aims to shed light on the multi-dimensional aspects of this influence, examining how mass media serves as a catalyst for both empowerment and vulnerability within tribal communities. Using an ethnographic approach, the research explores the intricate relationship between tribal women and mass media, investigating its effects on their sociocultural practices, gender roles, education, and economic opportunities. Tribal women from three different communities – Kurumar, Paniyar, and Kattunaickers – formed the sample of the study. The chapter presents compelling findings that illustrate how exposure to mass media has the potential to empower tribal women by providing them with access to information, knowledge, and alternative perspectives. As media platforms increasingly amplify the voices of marginalised communities, tribal women gain opportunities to challenge traditional norms and stereotypes, promoting their self-expression and asserting their agency. However, the study also uncovers the paradoxical side of mass media’s impact on tribal women. While it fosters empowerment, it concurrently exposes them to new vulnerabilities. Commercialisation and commodification of their culture, portrayal of unrealistic beauty standards, and media objectification create challenges for tribal women, perpetuating their marginalisation and reinforcing pre-existing gender disparities. This research contributes to the existing literature on media, gender, and marginalised communities, offering insights into the complexities of media representation and its implications for tribal women in Kerala. The study concludes by proposing a set of recommendations for media practitioners, policymakers, and civil society to ensure responsible and inclusive media practices that promote empowerment, preserve cultural heritage, and safeguard the rights and dignity of tribal women. Ultimately, this chapter advocates for a media landscape that not only informs and entertains but also uplifts and empowers the voices and aspirations of Kerala’s tribal women."

His work has been instrumental in shedding light on the challenges faced by marginalized communities and advocating for their social inclusion. Palackal has conducted extensive research on the struggles and movements of excluded people in Kerala, focusing on issues of land, water, and livelihood. Palackal has also made significant contributions to the study of social movements in Kerala. In the field of Kerala studies, he has published extensively on various aspects of Kerala Society, culture, and history. While it is impossible to fully capture the extensive contributions of Palackal in a single chapter, I bravely attempt to outline the broad paths of his work in the fields of sociology of identities, gender, culture, and development."

    "abstract": "Urbanisation is a pivotal demographic transformation that characterised the twentieth century, serving as a crucial indicator of modernisation intimately intertwined with economic growth and development. Significantly, in its journey as a developing nation, India is witnessing a rapid surge in urbanisation, a trend that surpassed expectations, as evidenced by the 2011 Census. The surge in India’s urban population is primarily attributed to a combination of net rural–urban reclassification and rural-to-urban migration. It is essential to recognise the distinctive nature of Kerala in this context, as the state diverges significantly from the patterns observed in other regions. The urbanisation unfolding in Kerala is not confined solely to designated towns and cities; instead, the entire state portrays a nuanced urban–rural continuum. In this study, an exploration is undertaken to dissect the trends and patterns of urbanisation in Kerala, delving into its unique characteristics and associated challenges based on data provided by the Census of India. Regression analysis is used to determine the factors that contribute to Kerala’s urbanisation, which shows that urbanisation process is influenced by a complex interplay of financial, economic and demographic factors. Over the decade, banking has become a crucial driver of urbanisation, highlighting its growing role in supporting urban growth and development. In contrast, the significance of investment in small-scale industries/micro, small and medium enterprises has diminished by 2011, suggesting shifts in the economic landscape and pointing to the rising importance of services and remittances as sources of urban expansion. Household dynamics, consistently significant in both years, emphasise the critical role of population changes and family structures in shaping urbanisation trends. Despite the continuous rise in urbanisation rates, there persists a noticeable sluggishness in development, especially regarding the provision of essential amenities. This aspect necessitates focused policy attention to address the challenges accompanying Kerala’s evolving urban landscape."

    "abstract": "Background: India has a high incidence of snakebite-related mortality, making effective snakebite management crucial. This study aimed to explore current practices, challenges, and opportunities for improvement in snakebite management across India.\n\nMethods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among physicians in India covering aspects such as scope of practice, snake identification, first aid measures, institutional management, and specific management practices for hump-nosed pit viper (<i>Hypnale hypnale</i>) bites. The survey included 37 questions across 5 sections, with data collected via emails, professional networks, and online platforms. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS Statistics 23 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY), and manual thematic analysis was applied to open-ended responses.\n\nResults: The survey revealed a discrepancy between physicians’ confidence and accuracy in snake identification, with some still reporting outdated first aid and treatment practices. Despite recognizing the importance of snake species identification, a significant portion of respondents incorrectly identified the snakes. The study highlighted variability in institutional practices for snakebite management, such as administering prophylactic antibiotics and tetanus prophylaxis and monitoring periods for asymptomatic patients. In managing H hypnale viper bites, a demand for specific guidelines and a monovalent antivenom was evident because the current polyvalent antivenom is ineffective for this species.\n\nConclusions:\nThe survey emphasizes the need for improved training in snake identification, standardized treatment protocols, and the development of region-specific antivenoms. It emphasizes the necessity of updating guidelines to address the unique challenges of snakebite management in India, particularly for species not covered by existing antivenoms."

    "abstract": "Events that unfold in the Middle East profoundly impact the social and political environment in Kerala, India’s southernmost state. This article examines the response in Kerala to the attacks and counter-attacks by the Hamas militants and the Israeli forces in and around the Gaza Strip since October 7, 2023, which resulted in a humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip. Traditionally, a pro-Palestine sentiment has been prevalent in Kerala due to its geographical proximity to the Arabian Peninsula, its notable Muslim population, and its anti-imperialist political discourses under the influence of the dominant Left ideology. However, there has been an increasing appeal for Israel in Kerala recently, especially among some Christian denominations. This article considers these factors and analyzes Kerala’s response to the Gaza crisis using news articles, statements by political and religious leaders, and the editorials of five prominent Malayalam language newspapers. Despite debates around the Gaza crisis in Kerala being less unequivocal, the state’s social and political circles largely stood in solidarity with the Palestinian people."

    "abstract": "Female migrant domestic workers (FMDWs) in Gulf countries face a plethora of challenges both from their motherland and from the country into which they migrate. As domestic work is considered menial work and is highly gendered as feminine, and due to it being conducted within the confines of private households, the workers face isolation and stigma, are often underpaid, harassed, and mostly overworked as well as are paternalised and penalised even by the systems at home as well as abroad. FMDW migration from Kerala to Gulf has many similar characteristics with other sending regions and countries – the destination being the same and the nature of work and reasons for migration highly identical – yet has its own origin and evolution, different from that of African countries, other major sending countries of Asia (Philippines, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Nepal and Indonesia) and other major sending states of India (Andhra Pradesh and Telangana). Currently, the migration from Kerala to Gulf for unskilled work, which is predominantly domestic work, is a phenomenon of middle-aged Malayali women making multiple journeys and is dominated by reasons like debt, dowry, distress, and the educational needs of children. At the same time, there are also middle-aged women who undertake sojourns, mostly with young expatriate families, for child care, to see the world, and to make a buck all at the same time – a win-win for both the employer and the employee. This chapter closely follows the narratives of both these categories of women and makes a qualitative analysis of their sojourns, illustrating their skilful migrations for unskilled labour."

    "abstract": "The present article is an attempt to explore the role of government in mechanising the coir industry of Kerala, which is expected to yield wider policy implications regarding the channels of state interventions in the coir industry for its betterment. The analysis of the government support received by the private sector coir manufacturers reveals that the financial support aims to develop the infrastructure of the firm. However, non-financial assistance like government procurement and participation in government-sponsored trade fairs positively influence the mechanisation index (MI), whereas the provision of subsidised raw materials has a negative influence on MI. In this respect, ‘Coir Kerala’ is a good initiative by the government to mechanise and thus improve the coir industry of Kerala. The study concludes that proper market interventions are required for efficient utilisation of the production capacity of the firms and thus to improve the performance of the traditional coir industry of Kerala. This, in turn, will boost the mechanisation and thus the performance again. This chain of actions and reactions will help the industry to overcome all its vulnerabilities and will lead it to prosperity."

Employing a qualitative survey method, in-depth interviews were carried out with 52 ASHAs shortly after the pandemic. The findings reveal that while ASHAs view the altruistic, community service aspect of their work as empowering, the state must recognise the burden of underpaid community care work on women, which is exhausting and contributes to time poverty and a lack of leisure. This study advocates for policy interventions to regularise ASHAs’ services and increase their remuneration from a gender justice perspective."

It examines how tied loans eroded Kerala’s policy autonomy and social model, disproportionately affecting marginalized groups. The state’s financial crisis and strained central relations led to accepting loans with neoliberal conditionalities, undermining welfare policies. Using the World Bank-funded Jalanidhi project as a case study, it contextualizes Kerala’s aid dependence within global capitalism, where aid often acts as “euphemized domination.” It reveals the model’s vulnerabilities, interlinked with exploitative global relations, and advocates for economic restructuring fostering self-reliance and people-centered development."

This study, part of ethnographic research, collected data from three Adivasi communities through in-depth interviews, observations and key informant interviews. The article focuses on how mass media technologies have influenced the awareness and educational attainment of the communities. The study proves that the worldview of the Adivasi communities in Wayanad has widened with the introduction of radio, television, mobile phones and the internet. Mass media has facilitated transformative changes in Anganwadi and post-Anganwadi education, including improved parent–student communication, overcoming language barriers, and increasing informed participation in decision-making. A positive correlation was observed between the diffusion of mass media technologies and educational performance. These technologies also contribute to building social networks and, consequently, employment opportunities. The study further notes that the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the diffusion of mass media technologies in Adivasi hamlets."

To tackle these exorbitant healthcare costs, mainly precipitated by a reliance on private hospitals, the state government partnered with the central government to introduce various Government-Sponsored Health Insurance (GSHI) schemes. This study traces the diverse effects that the state policy might have created in Kerala by using GSHI as a mechanism to divert the GSHI-covered households towards public hospitals between 2008 and 2020."

Primary data were gathered from the Kasaragod district in Kerala, encompassing 240 sample households representing the prominent tribes of the region, namely Mavilan, Marati and Malavettuvan. An index has been developed to evaluate the comparative level of social capital possessed by each tribe under investigation by incorporating its various dimensions. The results highlight that the overall effectiveness of social capital in the development of scheduled tribes in Kerala is marginal. However, there are statistically significant differences in the achievement of development outcomes between tribes with high social capital and those with low social capital. Tribes with a higher social capital index excel in bonding, bridging and linking dimensions. Hence, it is imperative to formulate tribal development initiatives with due regard to their distinctive social capital endowment."

Concurrently, there are disparaging views of sociology as ‘marriage-ology’ or kalyanology, hinting at the perception of a soft subject with little merit beyond preparing women for marriage. This chapter will delineate the role of women in the field of sociology in Kerala, including how institutional cultures have developed over the years. The relationship between sociology and women as study subjects will also be examined.

Employing advanced GIS and remote-sensing techniques, we explore the basin's geomorphological evolution and landform development. Our approach integrates data from a 1:50,000 scale toposheet and a 30 m resolution Digital Elevation Model (DEM), facilitating a detailed evaluation of basin characteristics. Through subdivision into KB-1 and KB-2 sub-basins, distinct morphometric patterns and morphotectonic features are discerned. The elongated basin configuration suggests ongoing tectonic activity, profoundly shaping its unique geomorphic evolution. To unravel tectonic influences, we employ morphometric indices, including the Relative Active Tectonic Index (IRAT), revealing neo-tectonic activity and dynamic landscape changes. Our study enriches our understanding of the Korapuzha river basin's evolution, illuminating the interplay between tectonic forces and geomorphic processes. Offering insights into tropical river systems, it contributes to broader landscape dynamic comprehension and informs sustainable land management practices. The IRAT calculation for the Korapuzha basin is based on the average of five geomorphic index classes, with resulting classifications indicating varying levels of tectonic activity. KB-1 and KB-2 sub-basins’ IRAT values enumerated as 2.2 and 2, respectively hence fall into classes 4 and 3, indicating low and moderate tectonic activity, respectively. The presence of tectonism in the study area revealed from geomorphic indices and IRAT, was acknowledged and evinced precisely by following the analysis of the SL index and GLA index method."

    "abstract": "<i>The Battle for Sabarimala</i> tells the story of one of contemporary India's most contentious disputes—a long running struggle over women's access to the Hindu temple at Sabarimala. In 2018, the Indian Supreme Court ruled that the temple, which had traditionally excluded women aged ten to fifty because their presence offended the presiding deity, had to open its doors to all Hindus. The decision in Indian Young Lawyers Association (IYLA) rocked the nation. Protests were launched around India, and throughout the diaspora, a record-setting human chain called the 'Women's Wall' was coordinated, and dozens of petitions were filed asking the Supreme Court to reverse its landmark opinion. Most significantly, the IYLA opinion led the Court to openly reconsider the Essential Practices Doctrine that has been a mainstay of Indian religious freedom jurisprudence since 1954.\n\nIn this monograph-length study of the dispute, legal anthropologist Deepa Das Acevedo draws on ethnographic fieldwork, legal analysis, and media archives to tell a multifaceted narrative about the 'ban on women'. Reaching as far back as the eighteenth century, when the relationship between temple deities and the government was transformed by an ambitious precolonial ruler, and coming up to the litigation delays caused by the coronavirus pandemic, Das Acevedo reveals the complexities of the dispute and the constitutional framework that defines it. That framework, Das Acevedo argues, reflects two distinct conceptions of religion-state relations, both of which have emerged at various stages in the—still unresolved—battle for Sabarimala."

    "abstract": "Kuttanad in India is known as ‘the rice bowl of Kerala’ and renowned for its unique rice cultivation system that is below sea level. However, rice production in this wetland ecosystem is seriously threatened by sheath blight disease caused by the fungus Rhizoctonia solani, which has resulted in a significant decline in grain quality and a 50% loss in yield. In the present study, we isolated two endophytic Bacillus subtilis strains, NIIST B616 and NIIST B627, from the roots of rice plants growing in the Kuttanad region and tested their efficacy in controlling sheath blight disease. We found that rice plants inoculated with a combination of both Bacillus strains and R. solani had a 64.71% lower disease incidence and a 31.02% higher harvest index than plants treated with R. solani alone. An analysis of defence-related enzymes and chemicals revealed that treatment with both isolates together greatly enhanced levels of l-phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL; 2.8 fold), peroxidase (POX; 7.4 fold), polyphenol oxidase (PPO; 4.5 fold), and total phenol (8.5 fold) compared with plants treated solely with R. solani, indicating that these isolates significantly increased plant defence responses through induced systemic resistance (ISR), and this finding was validated through a split-root experiment. More detailed analysis using gas chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) and liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) techniques revealed that cyclo-(Pro-Leu) and cyclo-(Pro-Phe) were the major components responsible for the antifungal properties of the two isolates and their capacity to trigger ISR in plants. Thus, the Bacillus strains and their metabolites may be deemed viable alternatives for controlling the prevalence of sheath blight disease in rice plants and augmenting rice production at unique locations such as Kuttanad."

    "abstract": "This paper discusses the role of the effigy in the celebration of the festival of Purim as enacted by the Cochin Jews of south India in three major periods: under Portuguese conquest in the sixteenth century, in Cochin in the twentieth century, and in a different topography in Israel. Cochin Jews at their peak only numbered 2400 prior to Indian Independence; they never suffered antisemitism except under the Portuguese and lived in harmony with their Hindu, Christian and Muslim neighbours. On the festival of Purim, role reversals took place to protest hierarchical social structures inherent in caste and religion, thereby enabling peaceful relations between members of different religions, communities and quasi-castes (jati) during the year. The inversions were expressed in the construction of effigies of the adversary, as well as in special songs, which represented symbolic protests against hegemonic domination, which addressed other daily injustices, based on gender. Today, the majority of Cochin Jewry live in Israel, where they celebrate Purim, embracing globalization and identification with world Jewry. The physical presence of the Cochin Jewish community, its very embodiment, like the effigy, has been almost totally eroded in India, while the body politic lives on in another world, Israel."

    "abstract": "This article concerns a representation of a temple festival in Tiruniḻalmāla, a major literary work in early Malayalam. The work in question focuses on a high-order Brahmanic temple of Āṟanmuḷa in the moment of a grave ritual and operational crisis. It emphasizes the restorative role of rather lowly rites of exorcism and purification including elements of dance, song, and drama. The article pays close attention to the structure of its textual matter and the literary strategies deployed by its author in meeting the performative exigencies of the genre. The festival itself seems today to have been long forgotten in the place of its origin. \n\nThe article attempts to understand the socioreligious functions of the festival by exploring the inner logic of its literary representation, drawing parallels to other cultural institutions of medieval Kerala and showing how its afterlife in folk possession dance rituals contributed to the transmission of a text that gave the festival its literary form."

    "abstract": "The South Indian soapnut tree, Sapindus trifoliatus L, is a midsized evergreen tree from the Indian subcontinent whose fruit can produce natural detergents, biodiesel, and biopesticides. In this study, we document the systematic destruction of soapnut trees through a citizen-supported tree census in an emerging Tier 2 city, Kochi, in South India. In the study, 3580 respondents allowed us to find and map 210 locations of soapnut trees across 411.57 km2. Kochi expanded suddenly in the early 2000s, with a drastic increase in built-up area (126%) and a steady decline in wetlands (57.6%) and croplands (15%). Habitat loss and removal from home gardens has quartered soapnut tree density, to 0.11 km−2. With only 50 trees remaining, the population of the South Indian soapnut will reach the brink of local extinction by 2080. Citizens have the power to conserve soapnut trees outside protected areas, yet only 3.41% of respondents were well informed. Knowledge transfer regarding biodiversity is being lost across generations. Frequently updating People’s Biodiversity Registers is essential to document and conserve biodiversity within cityscapes.Citizen reporting provides deeper information and data points than the work of expert taxonomists alone, provided the species is familiar to the locals.

The present study aimed to measure the effects of driver characteristics on aberrant and positive driving behaviours among bus drivers and to group drivers accordingly. The study was carried out among bus drivers of the government-owned road transport corporation in Kerala, India. A total of 1120 drivers took part in the survey, out of which 617 drivers returned the forms with all questions answered (response rate = 55.1%). SPSS version 27.0 was used for analysis. Structural equation modelling proved the predictive nature of driver characteristics on driving behaviours. K-means cluster analysis revealed clusters such as violating and angry drivers (cluster 1), knowledgeable drivers with positive driving behaviours (cluster 2), healthy and stress-free drivers (cluster 3), erroneous and stressed drivers (cluster 4) and calm drivers with positive driving behaviours (cluster 5). Positive relationships of anger and stress on aberrant driving behaviours and higher number of drivers in clusters 1 and 4 reveal concerns of safety. The study points towards the necessity of organizational commitment for improving driver characteristics for better driver behaviours and safer roads."

    "abstract": "The study intends to bridge the lack of baseline information on microplastic (MPs) contamination in two river systems (Periyar: the longest river, lifeline of the Kerala State and Chalakudy: the fifth longest river) and hence is highly relevant. Sampling was carried out twice during December 2020 and January 2021. Elevated level of contamination was recorded at midstream sites in Chalakudy and downstream sites at Periyar. Small-sized particles (<100 µm) constituted the majority (>45%) in both river systems resulting from the disintegration of larger particles or direct release of primary MPs. Prevalence of fragment shape, accounting for ≈48–71% across all sites in both rivers, resulted from the disintegration of meso or macro plastics. Preponderance of blue-coloured particles (≈33–67%) inferred potential risk to aquatic organisms. Low-density polyethylene emerged as the dominant polymer group, originated from packaging materials and bottles. Overall abundance and recovery rate in both rivers indicate that MPs occur at all sites, irrespective of land use patterns, sourced to the degradation of abandoned fishing gears, shipping, tourism activities, and untreated waste disposal. The high risk of microplastic pollution in the study area was endorsed by polymer hazard index and coefficient of microplastic impact index."

The study reveals that students from marginalised social groups experience significantly lower placement rates and exhibit substantially lower academic performance. Even after accounting for academic differences, marginalised community students are less likely to be employed, signalling labour market bias. Males within this marginalised group face even lower placement chances. When employed, marginalised group students are less likely to be employed in high-paying jobs. Interestingly, while females are preferred over males, especially in high-paying jobs, they are underrepresented in the engineering domain, particularly in the branches that are traditionally male-dominated. The study is among the first to comprehensively examine the interplay of multiple factors – employment disparity, wage levels, academic performances, caste and gender in campus recruitment."

To date, there is no reported translation of this scale into Malayalam, a language spoken by over 32 million people especially in the southern state of Kerala, India. In the present study, 656 community-dwelling older adults participating in the Kerala Einstein study (KES) completed the Malayalam version of the SHS. The Malayalam version demonstrated high internal consistency and good convergent validity, as assessed by comparison to measures of depression and anxiety. We also used factor analysis to determine that the Malayalam version of the SHS has a unidimensional structure, akin to the original English as well as other language adaptations. Our study adds to the repertoire of tools to measure happiness in non-English-speaking populations, enabling future research to explore the foundations of well-being across diverse cultures."

    "abstract": "The Western Ghats have been declared as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. Besides, it is classified as one of the world’s 36 biodiversity hotspots by Conservation International. The Western Ghats of Kerala have experienced devastating landslides and floods in recent years, which are triggered by climate change. This alarming situation calls for policymakers to develop a comprehensive climate adaptation policy at the local level. However, no study has yet thoroughly investigated this critical issue. Therefore, this study explores the prospects and trade-offs of climate rehabilitation policies for families living in the highly landslide- and flood-prone areas of the Western Ghats in Kerala, India. We have undertaken a mixed methodology comprising four focus group discussions followed by empirical analyses. Towards this, a semi-structured questionnaire is framed to gather relevant information based on the outcomes. The data are analyzed using robust logistic regression models. The findings indicate that most agricultural worker families support the rehabilitation policy, given their lower opportunity costs due to the absence of farmland ownership. On the other hand, agricultural families face considerable trade-offs regarding rehabilitation. Most agricultural families prefer to rehabilitate within a short distance from the current residence or construct a retaining wall as they fear rehabilitation to distant places will gravely affect their livelihood. This research highlights the potential for implementing a rehabilitation policy for marginalized communities heavily exposed to climate risks. Additionally, constructing retaining walls should also be a primary focus of the Government."

The book narrates and analyses the historical and contemporary situations that shape and reshape the strategies and practices of larger livelihood-environmental and identity politics in Kerala by drawing parallels from the rest of India and the global South. By employing Kerala as an example, it engages with and broadens debates in political economy, political ecology, and subaltern politics. The book moves through six ecospatial conflicts and assembles three key ideas – transverse solidarity, epistemological coalescence, and subaltern modernity – and applies them as analytical tools to form an overall framework of political ecospatiality."

    "abstract": "There is a growing interest in studying and unpacking the implementation of policies and programmes as it provides an opportunity to reduce the policy translation time lag taken for research findings to translate into policies and be implemented and to understand why policies may fail. Realist evaluation is a theory-driven approach that embraces complexity and helps to identify the mechanisms generating the observed policy outcomes in a given context. We aimed to study facilitators and barriers while implementing the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act 2003 (COTPA), a comprehensive national tobacco control policy, and the National Tobacco Control Programme 2008 (NTCP), using realist evaluation. We developed an initial programme theory (IPT) based on a realist literature review of tobacco control policies in low- and middle-income countries. Three diverse states—Kerala, West Bengal and Arunachal Pradesh—with varying degrees of implementation of tobacco control laws and programmes were chosen as case studies. Within the three selected states, we conducted in-depth interviews with 48 state and district-level stakeholders and undertook non-participant observations to refine the IPT. Following this, we organized two regional consultations covering stakeholders from 20 Indian states for a second iteration to further refine the programme theory. A total of 300 intervention–context–actor–mechanism–outcome configurations were developed from the interview data, which were later synthesized into state-specific narrative programme theories for Kerala, West Bengal and Arunachal Pradesh. We identified five mechanisms: collective action, felt accountability, individual motivation, fear and prioritization that were (or were not) triggered leading to diverse implementation outcomes. We identified facilitators and barriers to implementing the COTPA and the NTCP, which have important research and practical implications for furthering the implementation of these policies as well as implementation research in India. In the future, researchers could build on the refined programme theory proposed in this study to develop a middle-range theory to explain tobacco control policy implementation in India and other low- and middle-income countries."

Through their interviews, the author illustrates the sustained exclusion of the sporting body in contemporary Indian pedagogy. Specifically, the continuing prevalence of the colonial emphasis on the sporting body, as one whose strength and instrumentality are paramount, as well as its corollary postcolonial position, which treats this sporting body as inferior to the ‘refined mind’ of studious pupils, can be observed. Approaching the sports quota with a decolonising lens would require re-examining the disembodied nature of pedagogy in India’s higher educational institutions, acknowledging sporting students’ lived experiences, and a seamless integration—as opposed to separation/exclusion—of the sportsperson into higher education."

    "abstract": "Flood vulnerability assessment is crucial for developing effective flood management and mitigation strategies. The present study aims to understand the flood vulnerability of the Kallada River Basin (KRB) and identify suitable locations for safe flood sheltering facilities in the basin. \n\nAs part of this, morphometric analysis of KRB was carried out by dividing the basin into fifty-eight 4th-order sub-basins to understand the sub-basin-wise terrain characteristics and the degree of vulnerability to flooding. GIS tools were used to assess various morphometrical parameters, such as drainage frequency, texture ratio, ruggedness number, basin relief, bifurcation ratio, length of overland flow, drainage density, circularity ratio and area, and geo-environmental factors such as sand percent, rainfall, and mean slope of these basins. \n\nThe morphometric parameters exhibited distinct spatial trends, with higher values primarily concentrated in the east and northeast parts for certain parameters and in the western parts for others. \n\nUsing hierarchical cluster analysis, the sub-basins were categorised into six clusters, revealing that 51% were vulnerable to floods, 26% moderately vulnerable, and 22% not vulnerable. Sub-basins in the central and western KRB were found to be highly vulnerable to flooding, while those in the eastern parts showed moderate vulnerability or were not vulnerable. \n\nFlood vulnerability mapping was validated using flood data of 2018 and 2019. Additionally, the weighted overlay method identified suitable areas for flood shelters in moderately vulnerable and vulnerable sub-basins and the areas were categorized into highly suitable, suitable, moderately suitable, and not suitable areas. Most areas of SB53 and SB55 were found highly suitable, emphasizing their potential for flood shelter locations. \n\nThe findings of this study can be used by competent authorities to initiate flood mitigation and to develop targeted flood preparedness measures in similar river basins, particularly in the context of increasing flood events."

    "abstract": "In the face of global climate change, the urgent shift towards renewable energy sources such as solar power is vital for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and fostering a sustainable future, presenting a universal challenge and opportunity for energy policy worldwide. India’s adoption of rooftop solar photovoltaic is pivotal due to its vast solar potential, which aligns with national goals to increase renewable energy capacity, reduce carbon emissions, and achieve energy security. Kerala’s geographical location offers abundant solar potential, making it a prime candidate for the adoption of rooftop solar photovoltaic systems. Coupled with the state’s strong commitment to renewable energy initiatives such as the ambitious “SOURA” (solar subsidy program by the Kerala State Electricity Board) project and various incentives for solar adoption, Kerala stands at the forefront of India’s transition towards sustainable energy solutions. Understanding the barriers to rooftop solar photovoltaic adoption in Kerala is crucial for tailoring effective policies and strategies that address specific hindrances from economic constraints to informational gaps. This study employs a qualitative research method to identify the barriers to rooftop solar photovoltaic adoption among households in Kerala. Through face-to-face interviews with a purposively selected sample of 52 households, the research aims to gain in-depth insights into the multifaceted challenges hindering the widespread adoption of solar energy in residential settings. The findings reveal several key barriers: financial barriers, informational barriers, technical barriers, regulatory barriers, social barriers, and psychological barriers. Sentiment analysis indicates that while there is a predominantly positive attitude towards solar photovoltaic adoption, there are significant concerns that still need to be addressed. Addressing these barriers with targeted policy interventions and public awareness campaigns could significantly enhance the adoption of rooftop solar photovoltaic systems in Kerala."

    "abstract": "The exponential growth of social media data in the era of Web 2.0 has necessitated advanced techniques for sentiment analysis. While sentiment analysis in monolingual datasets has received significant attention that in code-mixed datasets still need to be studied more. Code-mixed data often contain a mixture of monolingual content (might be in transliterated form), single-script but multilingual content, and multi-script multilingual content. This paper explores the issue from three important angles. What will be the best strategy to deal with the data for sentiment detection? Whether to train the classifier with the whole of the dataset or only with the pure code-mixed subset from the dataset? How much important is the language identification (LID) for the task? If LID is to be done, how, and when will it be used to yield the best performance? We explore the questions in the light of three datasets of Tamil–English, Kannada–English, and Malayalam–English YouTube social media comments. Our solution incorporated mBERT and an optional LID module. We report our results using a set of metrics like precision, recall,  score, and accuracy. The solutions provide considerable performance gain and some interesting insights for sentiment analysis from code-mixed data."

    "abstract": "Enhanced understanding of extreme events is essential for comprehensive risk assessment promoting informed decision-making and early warning to ensure the resilience against challenges imposed by changing climate. This study proposes a novel multi-module integration framework for the comprehensive evaluation of future flood risk in the Greater Pamba River basin, Kerala, India. The integrative modelling framework is developed by assembling a Cellular Automata-Markov Chain (CAMC) based and Use/Land Cover (LULC) projections, Reliability Ensemble Averaging (REA) of Global Climate Model (GCM) rainfall projections, Bayesian approach-based population projection, and spatial analysis of projected infrastructure and Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). By seamlessly interweaving the associated datasets, we illustrate the intricacies of flood vulnerability, exposure, and frequency across multiple return periods (2, 5, 10, and 100, 200 and 500 year) leading to the creation of diagnostic and prognostic high-resolution flood risk maps. The resultant flood analytics and analyses shown that around 36 % of the villages/municipalities and between 70 and 80 % of the critical facilities like schools, hospitals, and flood relief camps are falling under high-risk zones, for the 100-year return period flood. This finding is in line with Kerala's devastating flood episode in 2018, which exhibited characteristics of a nearly 100-year return period flood. In light of a changing climate, population growth, and shifting landscapes, these approaches provide a roadmap for more informed decision-making and adaptive flood risk management measures."

    "abstract": "The present work intends to study the variation of heavy metals (HMs) to scrutinize the scenario of pollution index and associated environmental risk, as well as source weathering conditions along the Kabini River. \n\nThe decreasing order of concentration of HMs along the basin is Cr > V > Ni > Zn > Cu. The paper spotlights the pollution grade in sediments, assessed by the geo-accumulation index (Igeo), contamination factor (Cf), pollution load index (PLI), and enrichment factor (Ef). The assessment of ecological risk is studied as potential ecological risk index (RI), toxic risk index (TRI), and modified hazard quotients (mHQs). As per the Igeo and Cf, V and Cr concentrations are higher in the region. Further, PLI confirmed that 35% of samples exceeded the limits of sediment quality guidelines. The RI and TRI values show that a higher ecological risk is associated with Ni, V, and Cr and with Cu and Cr, respectively. Additionally, the 23% Ni and 20% Cu samples from mHQ indicate the severity of pollution in the aquatic environment. \n\nThe inputs from anthropogenic and natural sources change the concentration of these HMs along the region. Moreover, the study of CIA and plagioclase index of alteration plots confirmed the low to intense weathering conditions. The statistical approach shows the linkage between Cr–V, Cu–Zn, and principal component analysis–derived prominent sources: industrial and agricultural runoff, as well as higher silicate weathering, contribute to the HMs concentration in the region. \n\nThe Kabini River passes through different climatic and land-use domains of Kerala and Karnataka, which eventually regulate the HM concentration and geo-environmental processes in the region and affect the health risk to humans in one or the other way. The reference data generated from the present work are absolutely new and would be significant in the future for deriving sustainable development plans for the well-being of human beings and precious natural resources."

    "abstract": "Coastal communities across the globe are prone to imminent disasters and emergencies due to their geographic placement, and their fishing occupations add to their exposure to ocean-related disasters more during their occupational voyage. The fishermen in the state of Kerala, India, lead a distinctive lifestyle compared to the mainstream community, primarily because of a significant digital divide. This divide hampers their access to livelihood support, such as live market information and impedes any potential improvement in their quality of life through digital services. The community's transformation is possible only through discrete and gradual steps of progression by bringing services to different areas such as education, connectivity, technology adoption, business, and livelihood. This study revealed prevalent gaps in the fishing community, including a lack of digital access and communication opportunities in the deep ocean, a deficiency in digital capacity preventing them from leveraging the benefits of Information and communications technology (ICT), leading to community isolation from digital inclusion and limiting economic opportunities. To address these issues, the study proposes an IoT-enabled digital ecosystem, transforming the community into a smart digital community. This ecosystem integrates a low-cost deep ocean communication solution, supportive software applications, a blockchain-based e-commerce platform, and a sustainable social change model for technology adoption. Proper adoption and utilisation of the digital ecosystem can strengthen the community's resilience to natural disasters, and climatic changes by providing relevant information and livelihood resilience by offering them an e-commerce platform to improve income and reduce their vulnerability. It will equip them to enhance their responsiveness to changing environmental and social factors and bounce back to build their innate resilience."

    "abstract": "Despite its critical importance for health, agriculture, and the economy, and its key role in supporting climate change adaptation, groundwater quality remains vulnerable to contamination and is often neglected until significant deterioration. The groundwater resources of Kerala, one of the southernmost states of India, are under escalating stress and scarcity, despite a high well density with 62% of the population relying on groundwater from approximately 6.5 million open wells. This study investigates the detailed hydrogeochemistry and predicts groundwater quality zones of the state using machine-learning techniques viz, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), support vector regression (SVR), artificial neural network (ANN) and random forest (RF) regression. The hydrogeochemical analysis reveals varying groundwater quality across the state. Among the different machine learning models, RF shows higher goodness of fit (R2: 0.922) with minimal prediction error (root mean square error: 6.29 and mean absolute error: 3.12). The predicted groundwater quality was validated using the spatially distributed stiff diagrams, visually representing water composition trends of each well. The very good, good, moderate and poor groundwater quality zones occupy 31.7%, 40.4%, 20.4%, and 7.4% of the state aligning accurately with the groundwater quality scenario of the state. Additionally, groundwater drinking risk assessment was conducted, considering that 7.4% of the state experiences poor-quality groundwater. Integrating groundwater quality maps with population data, the study assessed potential health risks due to consuming untreated water. Nearly 0.59 million people across 252 local self-government bodies (LSGs) are susceptible to consuming poor quality groundwater, which may pose potential health risks. This observation provides valuable insights for sustainable groundwater management and public health safeguarding and the findings of the present study are useful for achieving sustainable development goal (SGD) 6 (clean water and sanitation) and long-term groundwater management in Kerala."

To date, there is no reported translation of the AES into Malayalam, a language spoken by over 32 million people in the southern Indian state of Kerala. In the present study, we aimed to validate the Malayalam version of the AES.\n\nMethods: Six hundred sixty-one community-dwelling older adults without dementia participating in the Kerala Einstein study completed the Malayalam AES. We assessed the internal consistency and the validity of the Malayalam AES, using another measure of apathy, as well as measures of depression and anxiety. We also used principal component analysis (PCA) to determine the dimensionality of the Malayalam AES. Finally, we assessed possible sex differences in apathy.\n\nResults: The Malayalam AES demonstrated high internal consistency and good validity, and the results of our PCA indicate that it has a three-component structure, as in the original English version and other translated versions. We found that while overall apathy scores were similar, the relationship with other neuropsychiatric symptoms differed by sex, with stronger relationships found in male participants compared to female participants.\n\nConclusion: Our study provides another tool to screen for apathy in non-English-speaking populations, an important early risk factor for cognitive and functional decline, and enables future research across diverse cultures."

There is currently limited data available on the immune response to NiV infection. We aimed to elucidate the specific immune mechanisms involved in protection against NiV infection by analyzing the immune profiles of survivors of the Nipah outbreak in Kerala, India 2023. Immune cell populations were quantified and compared between survivors (up to 4 months post onset day of illness) and healthy controls. Statistical analysis was performed to explore associations between immune profiles and clinical outcomes. Immune signatures common to all three cases were: a heretofore undescribed persistent lymphopenia including the CD4+ Treg compartment with the relative expansion of memory Tregs; trends indicative of global leukopenic modulation were observed in monocytes and granulocytes including an expansion of putatively immunosuppressive low-density granulocytes described recently in the context of severe COVID-19; altered mucosal homing with respect to integrin beta-7 (ITGB7) expressing subsets; increased mobilization of activated T-cells (CD4+ and CD8+) and plasmablasts in the early phase of infection. Comparative analysis based on clinical presentation and outcome yielded lower initial viremia, increased activated T-cell responses, expanded plasmablasts, and restoration of ITGB7 expressing CD8+ T-cells as possible protective signatures. This longitudinal study delineates putative protective signatures associated with milder NiV disease. It emphasizes the need for the development of immunotherapeutic interventions such as monoclonal antibodies to blunt early viremia and ameliorate pathogenesis."

Statistical analyses were applied, including correlation, one-way ANOVA, and regression.\n\nResults and discussion: The temporal dimension is particularly interesting, as individuals three to five years post-treatment report heightened CRF and QoL scores. Furthermore, the research unveils the pivotal role played by predictors such as marital status, educational attainment, and employment status in shaping QoL. Marital status and education emerge as positive predictors of well-being. The study unveils compelling insights into AYA cancer survivorship, revealing a profound impact of CRF on the quality of life dimensions. The role of spirituality, sometimes affecting social connectedness, adds intrigue.\n\nConclusion: The findings provide insights into the complex world of female AYACS, compelling researchers to ponder the significance of addressing CRF and tailoring rehabilitation systems during the critical post-treatment phase, with recognition of gender-specific challenges."

Our contribution is twofold: (1) conceptually, we propose a framework to investigate the promises and pitfalls of polycentric climate governance in a federalist system with a particular focus on aspects of scaling and institutionalisation, and (2) empirically, we compare solar power development across three Indian states with favourable conditions for solar power but varying performance. \n\nBased on a qualitative analysis of interviews and documents, we show how state governments with different party backgrounds have been vital in implementing policy changes and overcoming political barriers. Still, very few bottom-up initiatives exist and were successfully institutionalised."

    "abstract": "In a society rife with gender stereotypes and discrimination, children frequently learn to accept gender roles that are not necessarily equitable to all genders. Many factors during childhood and adolescence impact children’s beliefs and actions about gender roles. These attitudes and behaviours are typically acquired and reinforced at home. Most research on gender socialisation place greater emphasis on typical growth and average patterns across children. \n\nThe present study investigated how gendered ideas and actions of parents influence their children’s attitudes about gender roles. The study examined gender stereotypes held by children about different concepts like occupation, appearance, play, and responsibilities, and how family contributed to their development. Data was collected from ten participants (of age between 4 and 6 years) from Kozhikode district, Kerala, using a semi-structured interview. The data was transcribed, and thematic analysis was performed. \n\nThe study found that children had a solid gender-stereotyped viewpoint on all of the factors examined and that children make gender-stereotyped decisions, attitudes, and perceptions from a very young age. Role modeling and promoting distinct gendered behaviors are found to be the two ways through which parents and families impact children’s gender development. \n\nThe present study has demonstrated that certain types of exposures from the family influence children’s learning of conventional gender roles. Society must establish a more gender-equitable context that will preserve the future psychological, social, and professional development of children."

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to examine the differences in standard of living between households with migrants and households without migrants in Kerala, one of the most remittance-receiving states in India. \n\nData from the Kerala Migration Survey (2018) was used for the study. The survey sampled 15,000 households, including both households with migrants and without migrants. Cross tabulation, standard living index, and ordered logistic regression analysis were used to examine the difference in living standards between households with migrants and without migrants. \n\nA total of 28.4% of households were with migrant and 71.6% were without migrant in this study. The proportion of households without migrants that fell below the poverty line (42.38%) was higher than the proportion of households with migrants (30.13%). A significant percentage of households with migrants (16.3% and 38.7%) lived in houses categorised as “luxurious” and “very good,” respectively, compared to households without migrants (10.4% and 27.8%, respectively). In addition, households with migrants allocated a larger budget for house construction, with costs exceeding ₹5 lakhs, compared to households without migrants. The proportion of households with migrants that owned consumer durables such as vehicles, home appliances, and electronic gadgets was also higher than their counterparts without migrants. \n\nIn terms of standard of living, households with migrants had a significantly higher proportion of households with a better living standard than households without migrants. Further, households with migrants had a significantly higher likelihood of having a better standard of living than households without migrants (AOR: 1.729; CI: 1.609–1.858). \n\nThis study highlights the significant positive impact of international migration on the living standard of households, including better housing quality and higher levels of ownership of consumer durables. These findings suggest that international migration can be a positive force for development, leading to improved standards of living for both households with migrants and non-migrants."

    "abstract": "The high rice prices of 2023 have highlighted the need for increasing rice productivity. But improving productivity, especially in low-performing rice-producing regions, should also improve incomes for the numerous smallholder cultivators. This article examines what we can learn from the experience of high-performing rice-growing regions, which have both high rice yields and incomes. We focus on two best-performing villages from Kerala, southern India and Mekong Delta, Vietnam. Using a detailed case study approach combining farm budget analysis, counterfactual simulations using agricultural household models, and qualitative insights, our analysis shows the contribution of price support, irrigation, and agricultural research in these two regions to the current situation. While price support was the prominent factor in Keralaʼs village, irrigation and extending the cropping intensity was important for farm incomes in the Mekong Delta village. This comparative analysis demonstrates the need for an ongoing evaluation of price and non-price factors and supplementing farm incomes through specific interventions for developing low-performing rice-producing regions."

Dalit women writers in Kerala gained momentum with a prospectus to challenge misrepresentations and stereotyping by mainstream and Dalit men writers. Their writings criticise the caste order that demonstrates its power through symbolic forms of violence against Dalits in Kerala. \n\nThis article is an attempt to understand representation and counter-representation of caste-based violence and oppression in three Malayalam short stories by Dalit women writers, Rekha Raj, Reena Sam, and M. D. Dhanya. The stories are analysed on the background of Teresa De Lauretis’s concept of the ‘rhetoric of violence’ that recognises how the language of violence codifies and constructs objects and subjects of violence to propagate dominant ideologies. \n\nThe article will also look at how the authors depict the traumatic effect produced by caste-based violence on Dalit psyche."

    "abstract": "Microplastics, an emerging contaminant, are widespread in oceans around the world, and rivers are the key conveyors of these pollutants into the oceans. There exists a dearth of available data pertaining to seasonal fluctuation, spatial distribution, and risk assessment of microplastics in rivers extending from upper reaches to the lower reaches. The collection of such data is of utmost importance for the purpose of formulating beneficial management strategies for riverine microplastics. \n\nIn order to bridge this research gap, an investigation was made in the Periyar River in Kerala, which is exposed to anthropogenic stress and is at risk of microplastic pollution. A total of eighteen sites (six sites each from downstream, midstream, and upstream) along the 244 km of the river were investigated across three seasons in a year. \n\nThe study revealed a discernible pattern in the spatial distribution of microplastic concentrations, wherein there was a rise in abundance from the upstream to midstream and then a sudden increase of abundance along the downstream regions towards the lower reaches. The highest mean microplastic abundance of 124.95 items/L was obtained during the monsoon season followed by post-monsoon season i.e. 123.21 items/L and pre-monsoon i.e. 120.50 items/L. \n\nThe predominant forms of microplastics were found to be fibres, fragments and filaments. Most prevalent polymer types acquired were polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP). Pollution hazard index (PHI) and pollution load index (PLI) were also evaluated to assess the water quality of this river. \n\nThe findings of this study conclude that the Periyar River is polluted with microplastics throughout its course and offer significant insights into the detection of microplastic origins in river systems and lend support to the implementation of potential measures aimed at mitigating their impact."

    "abstract": "A multitemporal morphological and heavy mineral study was conducted on the coastal area of the southwest coast of Kerala, India between two major rivers namely Chandragiri River and Karingotte River. The study revealed an interesting distribution pattern of heavy minerals in the area. An offshore fault and a minor river, Chithari River on land, divided the area into two sectors, namely sector-1 and sector-2. Sector-1, located north of the river, is characterized as a submerging coast and exhibits erosion, while sector-2, located south of the river, is characterized as an emerging coast and exhibits accretion. The study found that the total heavy mineral concentration in the area ranged from 2.9 wt.% to 37 wt.%, with an average of 13.65 wt.% in sector-2 and 7.38 wt.% in sector-1. This difference in heavy mineral concentration is reflected in the iso-concentration map, which shows that sediment in sector 2 is more enriched with heavy minerals. Furthermore, the mineralogy of the heavy mineral suite also differs between the two sectors, with sector-1 dominated by ilmenite-garnet-sillimanite suite and sector-2 dominated by garnet-ilmenite-sillimanite suite. Though the unique distribution of heavy mineral placers in the two sectors is influenced by factors such as geology, geomorphology, and surface and subsurface structural features in the area, the distribution and concentration of heavy minerals in the area were found to be influenced more by coastal geomorphology. Hence this study highlights the importance of considering coastal geomorphology in understanding the distribution and concentration of heavy mineral placers."

    "abstract": "Most research studying financial behaviour, including those studying the behaviour of economically deprived sections, have ignored manual labourers. They are a segment that plays a significant role in economic development, but the lack of access to economic resources forces them to perform undesirable financial behaviours. Even though policymakers claim that removing stress in managing money is one way of achieving financial well-being, somehow, their financial empowerment has been overlooked in mainstream literature. \n\nThis study aims to develop and validate a measure of financial behaviour for the toiling class and to assess how different demographic segments vary in different dimensions of behavioural practices. An 18-item scale has been developed, taking input from several existing measures of financial behaviour and considering the unique characteristics of the population. The behavioural attributes of 401 labourers were measured in Kerala. \n\nFactor analysis resulted in four components with coherent reliability. The alpha reliability of the whole scale was 0.864. A detailed analysis using demographic variables revealed that gender, age, and education are significant for most of the behavioural dimensions and overall financial behaviour. The type of labourer was found to be significant for three behavioural dimensions. Other than providing a measure of financial behaviour for students and researchers of economically deprived sections, a scale can help counsellors, educators, and policymakers bring focused and constructive interventions into the lives of the poor."

    "abstract": "Objectives: Surveys conducted on a global scale have revealed a significant level of importance in artificial intelligence (AI) among medical pupils’. There have been no inquiries overseen in Kerala to explore the opinions of medical students regarding the consumption of AI in health care or their level of understanding of AI. We seek to evaluate the depths of Kerala’s medical learners concerning AI, both in the field of health care and its potential integration into the medical program. \n\nMethods: A digital scrutiny apparatus was created through a thorough examination of existing text and collaboration with doyens in the field. The inquiry was tested with a trio of medical learners and improved based on their valuable input. We distributed a digital probe to all medical pupils in Kerala, which amounted to around 20,000 students. The survey was available for responses from April 1st, 2024 to June 1st, 2024. The students’ responses were carefully analysed, both in terms of categories and the content of their free text comments. The analysis was conducted using open coding techniques to ensure a thorough qualitative analysis. \n\nResults: In total, 1000 students provided comprehensive answers to all the questions. A significant proportion of students (82.0%) fell within the age range of 20-29 years, pursuing medicine as their undergraduate degree (85%). Many students showed a keen interest in AI, with a significant majority (79.9%) expressing their curiosity. A large percentage (83.1%) asserted to have a basic realizing of AI, but when it came to the fundamental computational principles of AI, only a minority (39.8%) agreed that they grasped them. Similarly, more than half of the students (51.6%) acknowledged their lack of knowledge regarding the limitations of AI. Most students (81.1%) had not obtained any instruction in AI. A significant portion of students (57.3%) expressed their support for incorporating AI into medical training, while a majority (76.2%) expressed a desire for increased emphasis on teaching AI in medicine. A significant portion (61.3%) of medical students expressed a lack of worry about the potential effect of AI on their job safety as doctors. According to the survey, the majority of students believe that radiology, pathology, and medical administration are the specialties that will be most affected by AI. On the other hand, psychiatry, palliative care, and obstetrics and gynaecology are considered to be the least likely to be stuck by AI. Through qualitative study of the free text notes, it was discovered that AI is viewed as a valuable tool rather than a replacement for doctors. This finding emerged as a common theme. \n\nConclusion: It seems that medical students in Kerala have shown a keen interest in AI. However, their knowledge about AI is limited, and they feel they lack a deep understanding of its fundamental computational principles and limitations. It seems that AI is currently lacking in the medical curriculum in Kerala and India, and a majority of surveyed students expressed their support for its implementation. These findings align with previous surveys conducted on a global scale."

    "abstract": "Heavy metal contamination is a major environmental and ecological threat worldwide, posing significant challenges. Excessive accumulation of heavy metal like cadmium in the environment poses significant risks to both the environment and human health, particularly in regions with industrial activities and insufficient waste management practices. In this study, we focused on optimizing bacterial consortia composed of Aeromonas hydrophila and Psychrobacter nivimaris for efficient removal of cadmium from contaminated environments, with specific emphasis on areas near the Cochin backwater system in Kerala, India. Sampling conducted at Sreebhoothapuram and Eloor Ferry Kadavu stations near Fertilizers and Chemicals Travancore (FACT) revealed these sites as having significant cadmium accumulation. Bacterial strains isolated from these stations exhibited notable resistance to cadmium, with levels reaching up to 40 mg/l and these strains maintained similar growth conditions, making them good candidates for constructing a bacterial consortium. The Cd-resistant bacteria were characterized and identified as Aeromonas hydrophila and Psychrobacter nivimaris. Through a synergetic approach, a consortium comprising two bacterial strains from different combinations obtained from these stations demonstrated promising cadmium resistance, reaching up to 60 mg/l. Mixture design optimization facilitated the determination of an optimal ratio (Aeromonas hydrophila: Psychrobacter nivimaris) = (0.329:0.671) for maximum removal efficiency. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis of both individuals and the consortium revealed morphological changes, such as modifications in the cell wall, shape, and size of the bacteria, that occur during the absorption of Cd (II). The efficiency of the optimized consortium was validated through Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy, achieving an impressive removal percentage of 96.5% for a real wastewater sample with a Relative Standard Deviation (RSD) less than 10%. This study underscores the potential of tailored bacterial consortia as effective bioremediation agents for Cd-contaminated environments, particularly in regions with elevated cadmium levels like the Cochin backwater system in Kerala."

To formulate the shape grammar, 36 samples of mana/illams across Kerala were architecturally documented, analysed, and their characteristics and differences in typology were determined. \n\nThree typologies of mana/illams are identified; spatial configurations, proportions, and hierarchy are examined, from which the vocabulary and rulesets for the shape grammar are formulated. Sixty-eight shape rules are defined across 20 stages. Sixty plan typologies of mana/illam are generated to illustrate the grammar."

    "abstract": "The Indian west coast is under constant threat from climate change-induced hazards. Various social, economic, and infrastructural disparities along the coast cause significant variations in climate vulnerability. Current literature assesses vulnerability either over (1) a large area with poor spatial resolution or (2) a local area with better spatial resolution. The former assessments provide more comprehensive and broad insights into large spatial trends of vulnerability, while the latter provide more accurate and specific inputs needed by the local governments for effective intervention. However, there is a lack of studies that assess vulnerability simultaneously at a high-resolution and over a large geographic area, due to inadequacies in existing methodologies and difficulty in data management and analysis. This is a key gap that we address in our paper. \n\nWe assess climate vulnerability of the entire Indian west coast at the village level, and propose a novel machine-learning based methodology tailored for high-resolution assessment over large geographic areas. This helped us produce the first high-resolution (i.e. village-level) climate vulnerability map of the entire Indian west coast. \n\nWe found that the state of Maharashtra has the highest number of vulnerable villages and the state of Kerala has the least number of vulnerable villages. We collate and utilise a large dataset of 112 indicators describing socioeconomic characteristics, infrastructure and availability of financial services, among other aspects, to obtain a comprehensive picture of vulnerability. We analyse geospatial trends and attribute high vulnerability to specific indicators, which will help in effective decision-making at the village level."

    "abstract": "In this article, I discuss the rise of Syro-Malabar Catholic missionary work in India in the mid-twentieth century and the United States today. At a time when India was beginning to curb foreign missionary work in India, in-house Syro-Malabar Catholic missionary work was on the rise. I examine the racial differences between (white) Catholic missionaries and (brown) dominant caste Catholics. \n\nIn India, there are three rites of Catholicism: Syro-Malabar, Syro-Malankara, and Latin. While the Syro-Malabar and Syro-Malankara rites are considered ‘forward’ caste in the state of Kerala, Latin Catholics are recognised as OBC. The majority of Catholics in India are Dalit and Adivasi, but the Catholic hierarchy remains overwhelmingly dominant caste. Thus, there is a caste division between rites of Catholicism in India which plays into missionary work. This caste dynamic is key in understanding Syro-Malabar missionary work especially outside of the state of Kerala. \n\nIn the US, Syro-Malabar dominant caste priests may experience racism especially in predominantly white rural areas where they have little support systems in place. They also may be sent to Native communities, entering into the long history and present of Catholic settler colonialism.\n\nI examine how caste and race configure Catholic missionary work by specifically examining how the Catholic hierarchy is structured by caste, how caste and race may shape how spiritual labour is perceived by Catholics and non-Catholics alike, and how caste and race shape how priests themselves view the spiritual guidance of white, Indigenous, Dalit Bahujan, and Adivasi parishioners."

This paper brings together the development literature on the “participatory turn” with Henri Lefebvre’s work on social spaces and autogestion, to move beyond the “what” and “how” of participation, to add the question of “where” in exploring efforts to overcome social segregation and build sustainable integrated communities. It discusses two very distinct regional cases—Kerala (India) and Northern Ireland—as examples to argue that our analysis of the potential for transformative politics in society needs to include a study of its “participatory spaces”, and that this requirement transcends simple binaries like North/South, institutional/non-institutional, and top-down/bottom-up."

    "abstract": "This study analyses the women’s periodicals that were in circulation among the Muslims of Kerala, South India, during the early twentieth century. They were published by small-scale print houses and Muslim women associated with these periodicals as writers, editors and publishers, shaping a highly porous public sphere unlike the nationalist and colonial homogenous imaginations of the public. These early writings from Muslim women expose the entanglement of imagined rights and community identity embodied in faith and piety in colonial modernity. They ought to be studied to understand how social identity drew considerably from the domains of religion and community, if not region, and that gender and nation played less significant roles in their imagination of modernity. Moreover, their engagement with the West was not determined in the context of resistance to colonial administration alone, but also in a deeper and more complex history of Islam’s encounters with it."

    "abstract": "The centuries-old Eravimangalam Subramanyaswamy Temple in the Malappuram district of Kerala, is one of many active temples with significant remnants of historical outdoor wall paintings threatened with being rebuilt/replastered with modern materials. As the significance of the site to the local community is the figure of the deity housed within the temple, the shrine’s outer structure carrying the historical wall paintings is considered replaceable. \n\nThis work explores the creation of tools that communities can use in the future to make an informed choice about sustainable conservation of their heritage, and to place some significance on the structure as well as the deity represented. \n\nThe study uses two main approaches: virtual reconstruction, and the testing of greener formulations for the removal of deposits on outdoor wall paintings. 3D reconstruction and image manipulation were used to create visualisations of a possible finished treatment, and supported by cleaning tests on mock-ups of the wall paintings that reproduce the original materials, techniques, and their present condition. Testing of greener formulations was performed to remove deposits from burning oil lamps, as commonly used in temples in Kerala. The tested products that are derived from natural feedstocks are safer for human beings and will enable the local conservators to work with them without any adverse effects. \n\nThis work aims to serve as a means to initiate community involvement in decision-making and create opportunities for sustainable conservation."

We conducted in-depth interviews with 21 children aged 8-16 living in institutional care within Ernakulam District, Kerala, registered under the Juvenile Justice (JJ) (Care and Protection of Children) Act 2015. Semi-structured interviews covered various domains, including demographics, emotional well-being, social interactions, behavioral issues, academics, and coping mechanisms. Attride-Stirling’s thematic network analysis was used in the data analysis to identify significant themes. \n\nThe themes identified include (a) emotional well-being and self-perception, (b) behavioural problems, (c) social networking and interaction patterns, (d) educational and career aspirations, and (e) strengths and coping mechanisms. \n\nOur study presents the multifaceted challenges encountered by children in Kerala’s residential child care institutions, highlighting the need to create a nurturing environment that fosters child-centric practices that are essential to ensure their well-being and better prospects for their future."

    "abstract": "Exploring the interactions of female sexuality and spirituality from a feminist lens, <i>Othappu</i> by Sara Joseph, is influential in the genre of women’s writing in Malayalam. Through a textual analysis of the novel’s prize-winning translation by Rev. Valson Thampu, the paper examines how the author’s voicing of female resistance to patriarchal institutions gets effaced in the translation process. \n\nThe translation appears to be stripped of its explicitly feminist authorial voice, where the specific articulations of female subjectivity get replaced by a universally-appealing critical voice, accenting the translator’s ideology. Contrary to Joseph’s emphasis on the text’s engagement with a woman’s response to religion, Thampu voices his reading of the text as an “individual’s” conflict with faith. \n\nThe attempt is to locate the discursive presence of the translator and how the translator’s ideological leanings influence the transference of the feminist politics of the source text. Apart from closely comparing the original text to the translation in terms of the specificities of the language and analysis of the paratextual elements, a macro-dimension approach which locates the social context and ideological premise examining the translator’s role as creator of a new social narrative through translation is also employed."

She justifies her unusual storytelling as a lesson for readers, as narrating one’s life is atypical for ordinary individuals. This blend of anomaly and ordinariness is pivotal to understanding the methodological aspects of life writing. \n\nWhile truth and fact often blur in autobiographies, Banu’s life story gains significance from its combination of the strange and the ordinary. Despite claiming to represent many others, her experiences remain uniquely anomalous. Embracing anonymity as a body double, Banu’s identity becomes intertwined with her fate, resulting in a palimpsestic body overwritten with various faces and identities. \n\nThis article illuminates how Banu’s narrative challenges conventional notions of autobiography while highlighting the complexities of identity, anonymity, and storytelling in marginalised contexts."

The article looks critically at the introduction of a third category, ‘intersex’/‘cannot be identified’, in birth and death registrations in Kerala. \n\nBy locating the discourse within larger global discourses on intersexuality in general, and around gender minorities and sex minorities in India in particular, it argues that the legal recognition of intersexuality through the introduction of the third category but without other structural changes is a superficial attempt at fulfilling the imperatives of inclusion and recognition of intersex individuals as citizens with fundamental rights. A holistic approach that considers the legal, sociocultural and economic dimensions is required for the well-being of intersex infants and individuals."

How do everyday social spaces like teashops, reading rooms, and libraries reify—or subvert—dominant social structures like caste and gender? These are the questions that this book explores through a study of modern Kerala. Using archival material, discourse analysis, participant observation, and personal interviews, this book traces the transformation of public spaces through the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. \nThe volume focuses on how \"modernity\" has also been a struggle for access to public spaces, and non-institutional spaces like teashops, markets, public roads, temple grounds, reading rooms, and libraries have all been crucial to how political culture was shaped, and how dominant hegemonies—caste, class, or capital—have been challenged. It suggests that the secular public sphere that emerged in the last century in Kerala was a result of the constant negotiations between conflicting ideas which were put to test in these social spaces. At a time when digital spaces are fast replacing physical ones, this book is a timely reminder of the struggles that led to the emergence of secular public spaces in Kerala. It contributes to similar studies on public space that have emerged from other parts of the world over the last decades. \nA major contribution to understanding modern India, this book will be of interest to scholars and researchers of social history, political science, political sociology, gender studies, linguistics, and South Asian studies."

By the late twentieth century, when migration had become a regular phenomenon in Kerala, many writers felt that the Gulf had not been accurately represented in Malayali writing. This crisis in representation stemmed from various factors: the generational shift in migration from Kerala, drastic economic and social changes in the Gulf and in Kerala, and the persistence of the image of an old Arabia and the contemporary Gulf in an idiom of sacrality and wonder respectively. \n\nReading Babu Bharadwaj’s <i>Pravasiyude Kurippukal</i> (2000) as an exemplary Gulf memoir from the early twenty-first century, this chapter illustrates the strategies adopted by the memoirist to imagine the Gulf as a space of lived labour, depicting on the one hand the continued oceanic collective memory of ongoing transactions between the Arabian Gulf and Kerala, and, on the other, portraying the Gulf as a space of strangeness that each labourer has to individually live through in an embodied manner."

Interviews were conducted face to face or via Zoom and Skype platforms, audio recordings were transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed using a grounded theory approach aided by NVivo 12 software.We interviewed 38 key AMS stakeholders (pharmacists and doctors). India and the UK have dedicated AMS pharmacists (Doctor of Pharmacy and Master of Pharmacy graduates with opportunities for additional post-graduate qualifications respectively). Pharmacists in the UK lead AMS programmes, while in India, predominantly in the private sector, pharmacists drive AMS in collaboration with clinicians. In SA, pharmacists (Bachelor of Pharmacy graduates) participate in AMS out of their own commitment in addition to their pharmacy responsibilities. Private sector pharmacists drive AMS while public sector pharmacists participate in clinician-led AMS programmes. Current pharmacy curricula do not provide adequate training in AMS, and this limitation shapes pharmacist roles and acceptance in AMS among clinicians in India and SA. Support of mentors (doctors/senior pharmacists) and self-motivated learning are key factors for effective pharmacist involvement in AMS.A contextually developed, standardized and accessible AMS training programme along with pharmacy curricula modification to include AMS, may facilitate prominent pharmacist roles in AMS."

The book narrativises the author’s extensive explorations of the desert spaces in Saudi Arabia, where he worked as a newspaper reporter for 13 years. \n\nThis desert writing, arguably the first of its kind by a writer from Kerala, registers a wide range of emotions including desire, excitement, wonder, and fear as the author traverses the unfamiliar terrain. The desert, in Ahamed’s narrative, is not an essentialised ecological enclosure, but rather a politicised naturecultural space infected by human interventionist presences. The sublime is a visceral experience in Ahamed’s text as he negotiates the imbrication of beauty and precarity in the desert. \n\nIn the concluding section, the essay argues that sublime feelings have the potential to evoke environmental humility and foster non-anthropocentric awareness, both of which are crucial for the sustainability of our endangered planet. Considering the critical decline in interest in the sublime, as contended by Emily Brady, this essay seeks to re-engage with the trope to make a case for its continued relevance."

    "abstract": "As the developmental state attempted to transform the urban slum in Kerala into a model housing colony, narratives of decency, self-restraint, and sexual discipline became crucial for securing housing rights in the transformed space. ‘Bad’ and ‘good’ consumption; ‘bad’ and ‘good’ poor and images of ‘normality’ and the ‘normal home’ as the abode of the ideal citizen and worker were some of the strategies deployed by the residents of the Bangladesh Colony to encounter the quotidian world of moral non-acceptance. \n\nThis article examines how neoliberal articulation of rights through government projects often have contradictory effects on the lives of differently positioned women. The moral economy of consumption hinders the realization of the neoliberal ideal of the consumer-citizen. Practices considered as ‘excess’ in consumption by female sex workers were perceived as a threat to this slum community lying on the urban margins, resulting in their expulsion. \n\nThe article integrates theories of urban assemblage and queer temporality to understand how women sex workers resisted such expulsions. These theories converge on the notion of excess/abundance. Abundance of relationships, of political alliances and strategies, of consumption practices—exceeding heteronormative ideals—was deployed by women sex workers to resist their erasure and confinement into any single identity."

    "abstract": "All organisms on the earth-crust are exposed to natural background radiation since the evolution of the earth, as many environmental matrices such as soil, air, water bodies, vegetation, etc., act as the sources of natural radioactivity. The present study deals with the evaluation of indoor concentration of 222Rn (radon) in different dwellings with various construction materials used for the roof and floor in the industrial sites of Kannur district, Kerala. A pinhole-based dosemeter coupled with LR-115 Solid State Nuclear Track Detector and Direct Radon Progeny Sensor (DRPS) were respectively used for the measurement of indoor radon concentration and equilibrium equivalent concentration of radon. The indoor radon concentrations were found to vary from 102.30 Bqm−3 to 184.75 Bqm−3 and the values were within the recommended limits provided by International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP). The annual effective doses and excess lifetime cancer risks were observed in the range of 2.58–4.66 mSvy−1 and 7.68 × 10−3–15.60 × 10−3, respectively, and both exceed the world average values recommended by United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) 2000. The study shows that, the houses with marble floors and concrete roofs have comparatively higher values of radon concentration, which indicates the significant contribution of construction materials to the enhanced radiation levels inside the dwellings."

The complementarity of English proficiency and education is evident, with advanced language skills demonstrating substantial wage returns across different educational levels. The study underscores the economic value of English proficiency in the Gulf labour market and provides insights for policymakers and employers aiming to enhance migrant workers’ competitiveness."

    "abstract": "In India, individuals with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD) frequently encounter significant obstacles in accessing education, training, employment, and rehabilitation services. These challenges place substantial financial and emotional demands on their caregivers. This study investigates the pioneering approach of Kerala's BUDS institutions, which employ Community-Based Participatory Rehabilitation (CBPR) to empower these individuals and their families. \n\nThe study adopted a descriptive phenomenological approach and interviewed fourteen mothers of children with IDD and four special educators. The article evaluates the profound impact of BUDS institutions on fostering the community inclusion of individuals with IDD from the perspective of parents and stakeholders. \n\nThe emerging themes from the study are education, rehabilitation, and support to parents. The study offers valuable recommendations for further enhancement. While BUDS presents a promising model for inclusivity, it underscores the imperative need for collaborative initiatives and sustained investments to construct a genuinely inclusive society that accommodates individuals with IDD with dignity and equity."

    "abstract": "Noise pollution is an unintentional consequence of mining activities, needing rigorous assessment, monitoring, and mitigation techniques to reduce its impact on local residents and ecosystems. The study specifically examines the noise pollution from rare earth mining activities in the Neendakara-Kayamkulam (NK) coastal belt, Kollam, Kerala,  a region rich in ilmenite, rutile, sillimanite, zircon, and monazite. \n\nDespite the known environmental and health impacts of noise pollution, there is limited specific data on its magnitude and sources in this region, as well as a lack of effective mitigation strategies tailored to rare earth mining operations. Studies have indicated that mining operations, such as the movement of heavy mineral sands, considerably elevate noise levels, which have an effect on the environment’s quality and public health. This study seeks to fill the gap by geospatial mapping and assessing the noise levels and recommend measures to effectively mitigate noise pollution. \n\nSystematic noise measurements were conducted at 48 suitable locations within the NK coastal belt, including residential, commercial, industrial, coastal, and silence zones. The noise levels vary from 49.1 dB(A) near a religious place to 82.4 dB(A) near the local industry. The study employs geospatial noise mapping and land cover superimposition to implement class-specific mitigation measures for noise pollution in a coastal vicinity mixed land use area, including natural and vegetative barriers, operational scheduling, zoning, and land use planning."

We study and document the experiences of 1985 return emigrants (REM) through a quantitative survey conducted via Computer-Assisted Telephonic Interviews. The study utilises a comparative classificatory framework that categorises return emigrants into three groups: normal REM, distressed REM, and REM who returned to re-emigrate. While the REM have been a demographically, politically, and economically significant component of Kerala’s population, the COVID-19 REM represent a unique case in history that has the potential to not only affect the economy, society, and psyche of Kerala for many years to come, but to also provide valuable insights into the future of global labor migration governance."

    "abstract": "Amidst the challenges faced by economically developing countries in managing their plastic waste, the decentralised solid waste management practices followed in Kerala emerge as a unique example of a people-centric waste management programme. \n\nConsidering the importance of people’s cooperation in the success of such initiatives, we conducted an online survey among Keralites to understand their behaviours, opinions, and knowledge regarding plastic waste and its management. Further, the influence of sociodemographic attributes in shaping individual characteristics was also investigated. \n\nThe Plastic Waste Literacy Rate (PWLR) of the state was 62%, with women and older people being increasingly pro-environmental in managing plastic waste. However, despite this positive trend, a majority of women still resort to improper methods for disposing of sanitary pads. Illicit dumping of plastic waste was more prevalent in urban areas compared to rural ones. Even though the plastic waste collection service provided by Haritha Karma Sena (HKS) received positive feedback, most of the public (40.7%) opined against levying user fees for the same. \n\nIn essence, the present work offers insights to enhance the efficiency of the existing waste management programme, which will ultimately broaden the scope of adoption of the model by other regions in the developing world."

    "abstract": "The coastal zones are one of the most productive ecosystems in the world, rich in resources, supporting livelihoods and driving economies. The thickly populated coastal stretches of Kerala are grappling with multiple threats in the form of coastal hazards such as sea level rise, high waves, coastal erosion, and coastal flooding. To address these threats, a comprehensive multi-risk approach is adopted based on the Fifth and Sixth Assessment Reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), in which risk is conceived as a function of hazard, vulnerability, and exposure. \n\nThe study assesses and maps the risks associated with coastal hazards on the central coast of Kerala by developing a composite disaster risk index that integrates physical and socioeconomic variables specific to the study area. Under the hazard component, indicators such as sea level rise, precipitation intensity, shoreline change rate, proximity to cyclone tracks, storm surge height, and frequency of sea surges are considered. Vulnerability indicators encompass population density and land use/land cover, while exposure indicators include elevation, slope, mean significant wave height, and drainage density. \n\nThe risk assessment indicates varying levels of risk across the study area, with 2% coming under very high risk zone, 6% under high risk zone, 21% under medium risk zone, 43% under low risk, and 28% under very low risk. These findings help coastal planners and managers with effective disaster management and adaptation strategies."

    "abstract": "Due to the intensity and magnitude of environmental conditions, changes are directly impacting society. These sources cause significant damage to both natural ecosystems and man-made structures across numerous regions. Landslides can also damage property and infrastructure, disrupt transportation and communication systems, and even result in loss of life. The severity of the damage depends on various factors, such as the size and speed of the landslide, the type of material involved, and the location and vulnerability.\n\nThis review paper focuses on landslides in the regions of Kerala and Maharashtra from the Western Ghats (WGs) of the two states in southwestern India. The article provides an overview of the geological, climatic, and socio-economic factors that contribute to landslides in the region and the effects of landslides on the environment and local communities. Further, Kerala is situated in the Stable Continental Region (SCR). Therefore, tectonic and geological features contribute to the seismic activity of the SCR, specifically in the context of Kerala. The paper also discusses the area’s current efforts and strategies for landslide mitigation and management, including early warning systems and land-use planning. It also emphasises the importance of learning from past landslides and applying these lessons to reduce future disaster risks in the WGs region.\n\nThe paper examines recent advances in machine learning techniques for landslide prediction, early warning, and risk assessment, including artificial neural networks (ANNs), Random Forest (RF), and support vector machines (SVMs). It summarises findings from relevant literature, particularly highlighting the performance of slopes in the SCR under landslide conditions. This includes risk assessment methodologies and recommended forecasting mechanisms to address solutions."

The wet ash method was used to find the activity concentration of 210Po. The alpha activity was counted using a silver-activated zinc sulfide counter of 30% efficiency, and the activity was calculated. The average concentration of 210Po activity in soil samples ranged from 0.09 to 20.52 Bq kg−1, with an average value of 4.47 Bq kg−1. The soil texture was measured using the International Pipette method. Using the IBM Statistical Package of Social Science Software, the frequency distribution curve of 210Po is plotted and found to be lognormal. The data of 210Po are highly skewed, and the Kurtosis has a significant positive value. The 210Po activity concentrations are substantially within the World Health Organization’s recommended limits."

It draws upon the vast Protestant Christian missionary archives of the London Missionary Society, the Church Missionary Society, and the Basel German Evangelical Missionary Society to showcase the processes of negotiation, tensions, and underlying violence in the encounters between European ‘outsiders’ and local populations on the question of education. It examines the interplay of caste and education in reshaping ideas and norms of modern childhood and lower-caste community building in the regions of Travancore, Cochin, and Malabar. Set against a comparative historical perspective, the book argues for a greater focus on subaltern histories, especially the meanings and practices associated with educating poor, lower-caste children within the confines of formal schooling and beyond."

Oversimplified accounts have tended to depict the entire controversy as either a liberal intrusion into religious traditions or merely a Savarna feminist attempt to reform the Brahminical Hindu religion. What they overlooked was that these counter-mobilisations represented a widespread expression of yearnings for social justice and outrage against Brahminism. By critically contextualising the non-Brahminical contentions at Sabarimala, this paper also explores their various tendencies."

Evaluating urban ecological quality is crucial for monitoring environment-centered initiatives. The Akkulam-Veli Lake Basin, in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India, is threatened by rapid urbanisation. \n\nThe present study proposes a comprehensive evaluation of the ecological quality by the Remote-Sensing Ecological Index (RSEI), based on the four indexes: greenness (NDVI), wetness (WET), dryness (NDSBI), and heat (LST), from 2000 to 2023. The interrelationship between RSEI and land use has been studied to properly analyse human activities’ effects on the study region’s ecological quality. \n\nResults indicated that the mean values of RSEI experienced a drastic decline from 0.733 in 2000 to 0.645 in 2015, and further declined to 0.611 in 2023, indicating an overall deterioration in the status of ecological quality in the Akkulam-Veli Lake Basin. Moreover, Moran’s I index of 0.556 in 2000, 0.554 in 2015, and 0.552 in 2023 show that the sample RSEI values have a strong positive autocorrelation with adjacent values in the study area. \n\nThe study provides evidence for the need for systematic urban planning and serves as a scientific reference for policymakers to manage the ecological qulaity of urban areas effectively."

    "abstract": "Recent scientific investigations have highlighted concerning levels of microplastic contamination in marine ecosystems, posing significant risks to marine organisms and human populations. \n\nThis study aimed to assess the prevalence of microplastics in water, sediment, and tissues of commercially important fish species along the Malabar coast in Northwest Kerala, India. \n\nUsing Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), six predominant polymer types were identified, including HDPE, PET, and nylon. \n\nThe investigation revealed notable abundances of transparent microplastic particles, measuring <1 mm in diameter, particularly in gastrointestinal and gill tissues, with gastrointestinal tissues exhibiting the highest concentration of microplastics. A diverse array of morphotypes, including fragments (48.08%), fibers (28.84%), filaments (19.23%), and granules (3.85%), were observed within the coastal zone. \n\nThe study implicates various sources of contamination, such as direct discharges, runoff, and inadequate wastewater management practices, contributing to the substantial presence of microplastics in coastal environments. \n\nIn the light of these findings, the study emphasises the urgent need for the implementation of effective regulatory measures to mitigate plastic pollution in marine ecosystems. These results underscore the critical importance of proactive intervention to safeguard the health of marine ecosystems and human populations in coastal regions."

The main case study is a fourteenth-century market description that enumerates more than 250 objects, including grain, fish, cloth, medicinal items, flowers, and perfumes. The list creates a sense of excess in its use of both an actual image of abundance (Kerala is described as a vibrant commerce center) and a parallel image of linguistic abundance, with Malayalam, the local language, placed centre stage."

It seeks to examine her foray into politics in the light of the history of the discursive shaping of modern gender in Kerala on the one hand, and of feminist thought that has sought to revalue love as a virtue in public life on the other. \n\nI seek to read her repeated calls to infuse politics with love as part of an attempt to articulate an ‘affective politics’. I focus on three aspects of her writing that have been sources of ‘interpretative trouble’ for literary criticism in Kerala: self-love, love for the Masculine Other, and ‘love for the people’. \n\nWhat results is an imagining of politics strikingly similar to feminist imaginations elsewhere, which does encourage us to re-examine Das’s self-professed anti-feminism."

In the financial sectors, the government’s role via policies like augmenting MSMEs’ credit becomes completely significant. For evaluating CA towards MSMEs in Kerala, this study was developed. Analysing the challenges in accessing credit in MSMEs is the aim. For evaluating the outcomes, a simple random sampling methodology was deployed. In Kerala, the impact of credit knowledge was significant on MSMEs’ CA. As per the outcomes, a greater probability of augmenting loan access is engendered by the factor of challenges in attaining private equity funding and high lending interest rate."

A guessability task involving IPSC and PCS symbols for 30 target referents was utilised. Guessability scores for each participant as well as each symbol stimuli across two symbol sets were determined. \n\nThe guessability scores for IPSC were significantly (p <.001) higher than PCS. For both symbol sets, nouns were the most accurately guessed, followed by verbs, adjectives, and prepositions. The results also revealed that prompting and previous exposure to symbols tend to influence the transparency of symbols. Error analyses revealed that visual and conceptual cues within a symbol tend to influence guessability. \n\nThe results indicate that cultural and linguistic factors play a role in symbol guessability. The study highlights the importance of investigating the iconicity of IPSC and PCS symbols across different populations within India, before using symbols for educational/clinical purposes."

    "abstract": "Employee performance, supported by creativity and innovative work behaviour (IWB), is one significant predictor of organisational success. Creative employees with IWBs are crucial for an organisation to achieve sustainable and competitive advantage over its rivals. Human resource (HR) management practices are critical in fostering employee creativity (EC) and IWB. Organisational support and knowledge-sharing (KS) are other factors that largely contribute to EC and work behaviour. Organisations must understand these variables and their interactions to develop an environment of creativity and innovative work practices. \n\nThis article explores the mediating role of perceived organizational support, KS and EC between HR practices and employees’ innovative work practices. For this purpose, a theoretical model has been developed, and six hypotheses were set for statistical testing. Data collected from 404 employees working in various IT companies in Kerala are analysed using structural equation modelling. \n\nThe results showed significant direct and indirect effects of the variables in predicting employees’ work behaviour. The study’s insights provide valid information for strategy formation that fosters IWBs supported by HR practices, organisational support, KS and EC."

Height and weight of the patients were taken following standard methods and BMI of the patients was computed. Biochemical investigations such as their lipid profile along with Fasting, Post Prandial Blood Glucose values and HbA1C were obtained from patients’ medical records. Finally, the hypothesized model was developed and tested by Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) technique using SPSS AMOS 22.0. \n\nResults: The results show that height and weight highly influenced the BMI, among which weight, as shown by Standardized Regression Weights (SRW) Estimate- 1.102, Statistically Significant) influenced more than height (SRW Estimate:-0.683, Statistically Significant), weight had a positive influence, whereas height had a negative influence in selected Type II Diabetes patients. The model could not establish any relationship between BMI and lipid profile (SRW Estimate:-0.037, Statistically not Significant). \n\nConclusion: The findings suggest that in diabetes patients increase in BMI alone does not lead to any alterations in their lipid profile."

    "abstract": "This article explores the ways in which <i>Kocharethi: The Araya Woman</i> by Adivasi writer Narayan is a significant work in Adivasi literature in the way that it opens the life-world of a community, family, and individuals. \n\n<i>Kocharethi</i> is a story about the intimate ways in which the Malayaraya Adivasi community of Kerala relates to their land and its ownership. <i>Kocharethi</i> is about their exploitation, impoverishment, displacement and erasure, and their interaction and negotiation with modernity. It is not an overtly political piece of writing in the sense that it does not incorporate political consciousness, language, form, and content, but by centring the Adivasi life-world, it attains a political feat within a literary industry that focuses primarily on the upper-caste Hindus. \n\nIn a way, <i>Kocharethi</i> is an assertion of the autonomous identity of the Adivasi communities in general and the Malayaraya people in particular. This article therefore engages with complex insights into the relationship between the Adivasi identity, Christianity and Hinduism and how these religions have dehumanised and accepted the people within the fold only on their own terms. \n\nThe article looks into the important arguments about affirmative action, such as the policy of reservation for Dalits and Adivasis, and one of the transformations that the Malayaraya community underwent, that of conversion to Christianity. When it comes to the women of this community, it is even more complex. Hence, this article is also an attempt to reread the text by Kerala’s first Adivasi novelist, Narayan, from a feminist perspective without undermining the unique and significant position that it holds in Adivasi literature. It further looks at the issues of Adivasi women, specifically the Malayaraya women, and also analyses the patriarchal structure that is depicted in the text. The transition that the community makes due to modernity is placed subsequently."

    "abstract": "This article critically examines selected Malayalam films about transgender people, for their depiction of transphobia, and the representational politics in visualising violence against trans characters on screen. Transphobia is expressed through negative attitudes, feelings, or actions towards trans people or transness which include fear, aversion, and hatred, and it usually leads to violence. Trans people experience various forms of violence; verbal, physical, and sexual violence from society due to their gender nonconformity. \n\nIn Kerala, though the state acclaims itself as progressive through solidarities extended by the government and various community-based organizations, activists, and allies, transgender people continue to receive negative responses and violence in the public sphere. In the selected films, transfeminine people are depicted as quiet and helpless in resisting violence, as they are lynched and disrobed in public places by mobs. Whereas, the trans man in a film resists sexual violence, and cinema typecasts the courage for it as stemming from the underpinned masculinity of the character. \n\nThe article uses visual and thematic analysis of seven films released from 2005 to 2018 in the Malayalam industry and observes that cinema fetishises the body of the trans character as ‘unnatural’ and violates their dignity through molestation, and public lynching."

    "abstract": "Analysing the battle over Sree Padmanabhaswamy temple’s enormous treasure, the paper documents the litigious journey of the concept of sacred possession and heritage. It shows how the evolving and complex logic of secular governance in India provides the legal categories that animate this contestation over the deity’s wealth. \n\nWhile the enormous treasure trove housed in the six chambers of the temple’s basement ‘belongs’ to the idol (<i>murthi</i>) Lord Sree Padmanabhaswamy, the royal family of Travancore has held the right for over the last two hundred and seventy years to control the wealth as the Lord’s servants (<i>dasa</i>). \n\nThough the dispute over what is arguably the world’s largest temple gold and valuables collection began in 2007, it gained widespread media attention in 2009 when a public interest litigation (PIL) was filed. Since then, the royal family, temple management, and other stakeholders have been embroiled in the struggle for possession and control of the temple’s wealth. \n\nThe paper explores how legal frames of Anglo-Hindu law in their postcolonial avatars, material patrimony (gold and land), and notions of immaterial heritage (shebaitship) animated and framed this contestation. To this end, the paper maps the legal trajectory of the dispute and the public debates over the ownership and control of the astounding wealth of Sree Padmanabhaswamy temple. \n\nFurther, it decodes the legal reasoning behind the courts’ arguments and delves into ontological questions surrounding religious freedom and secularity. The discussion illustrates how notions of immaterial heritage anchored in ideas of kingship as well as kinship emerged as clinching evidence in the management and access to this sacred wealth. \n\nFinally, the analyses offer insights into the governance of sacred materiality through religio-legal categories in a postcolonial nation-state."

Through ethnographic study, we explore how Muslim faith healers in Kerala’s Malabar region integrate caste notions into healing practices, and also normalising them as an effective strategy for healing. \n\nCaste’s role in healing rituals and at faith healing sites is located within the context of lived Islam, lacking ritual legitimacy from institutional religion. This prompts us to consider how caste ideology extends beyond human material conditions into the spiritual realm, notably on sites of healing, with long-term implications on the political Islam in the region. \n\nIt further explores how the caste has been altered temporarily on healing sites in terms of categories of spirits, types of healers, social categories of possessed people and how political Islam have approached caste and faith healing in the context of reformist and revivalist movement in the region."

    "abstract": "Stardom in the present day has evolved into a comprehensive apparatus with its intersection with emerging digital media paving way to myriad star varieties. This paper tries to analyse the diverse ways in which female stardom manifests in the Malayalam film industry with the emergence of new digital domains and virtual sensibilities. \n\nThis article traces the evolution of female stardom in India and explores the new possibilities of Malayalam female stardom in the current technoscape. To exemplify this, the paper takes into account two female star personas from the Malayalam film industry, Parvathy Thiruvoth and Aparna Balamurali, to unravel the changed landscape of stardom today which is made possible through interventions of digital media where the female stars exhibit a deviation from the traditional associations of glamour/body to that of political and gendered articulations. It is substantiated by analysing digital media articles and social media issues circulating in Kerala’s digital landscape to establish how the present complexities in the new kinds of stardom requires a restructuring of ideas of gender discourses in new media spaces."

    "abstract": "Malayalee immigrants from Kerala, a southern state of India, constitute an ethnic diaspora community in Ontario, Canada. Though Malayalee diaspora is smaller, compared to other diasporas in Ontario, including various Indian ethnic diasporas, it is the fastest growing one. The second generation in the Malayalee diaspora is more prone to the host culture by means of acculturation and education. To preserve their own ethnic culture, the Malayalee diasporic communities enculturate their children in multiple ways. The present article explores the process of enculturation of the second-generation Malayalee diaspora happening through family, religion, ethnic organisations, and ethnic clusters. Family is instrumental in the enculturation process for maintaining the ethnic identity of the second-generation Malayalee diaspora by preserving ethnic food, dress, language, values, and other cultural traits. Ethnic associations, ethnic clusters, and religion also make significant efforts to encourage them to maintain ethnic Malayalee identity."

    "abstract": "The image of the tribal woman in movies is inextricably linked to patriarchal biases and pleasure aesthetics. What counts in representation here is the depiction of the alienated subject as an eroticised object with show-girl connotations. Even as progressive film makers valorise the sexuality of tribal women, movies like <i>Ayyappanum Koshiyum</i> offer a totally different and subversive perspective. Tribal woman as portrayed in the movie is displayed not as a spectacle but as a woman who defines her own power equations. \n\nThis paper critically analyses the visual nuances that subvert the hegemonic subaltern female discourse using the example of the Malayalam movie <i>Ayyappanum Koshiyum</i> and attempts to decode the politics of representation that continuously engages in redefining identities through various art forms especially films."

These black and white photographs made their entry into the art exhibition titled <i>Lokame Tharavadu</i> (the world is a single home) curated by Bose Krishnamachari in 2021 for The Kochi Biennale Foundation in collaboration with the Government of Kerala and sparked discussions on the visible aftermaths of climate change. \n\nThis essay attempts to analyse how photographing precarity transacts an eco-anxiety and solastagia even though one may not be directly linked to the eco-dystopian reality of homelessness that is captured in the photographs."

Long-term exposure to air pollution is a significant environmental risk factor for LC. \n\nThis study investigated the spatial association between LC and exposure to air pollutants in Thiruvananthapuram, using Spatial Lag Model (SLM), Spatial Error Model (SEM), and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR). \n\nThe results showed that overall LC incidence rate was 111 per 105 males (age >60 years), whereas spatial distribution map revealed that 48% of the area had an incidence rate greater than 150. The results revealed a significant association between PM2.5 and LC. SLM was identified as the best model that predicted 62% variation in LC. GWR model improved model performance and made better local predictions in the southeastern parts of the study area. \n\nThis study explores the effectiveness of spatial regression techniques for dealing spatial effects and pinpointing high-risk areas."

    "abstract": "Police officials’ stressful and physically demanding activities reportedly increase the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). This study explored the prevalence of CVD risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, tobacco use, alcohol consumption, and overweight among police officials in Kerala, India.\n\nA cross-sectional study was conducted among 255 police officials in selected police stations in the Thiruvananthapuram district, Kerala. The World Health Organization STEPs questionnaire for noncommunicable disease risk factor surveillance was used to collect information. We collected STEP 1 (demographics, tobacco use, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and diet) and STEP 2 (weight, height, and blood pressure) data. Multivariable analysis was done to identify factors associated with hypertension.The mean age of participants was 42 years (range: 30-55 years) and the majority were men (83.5%). Current use of tobacco or alcohol was reported by 22.7% of the participants. The prevalence of overweight was 64.7% and physical inactivity was 35.1%. Self-reported prevalence of diabetes was 7.5% and of hyperlipidemia was 11.4%. Hypertension prevalence was 40.4%. Among hypertensives, 35.9% were aware, 20.4% were treated, and 5.8% had controlled blood pressure. The control rate was 28.6% among treated hypertensives. When controlling for age, diabetes (odds ratio [OR]: 3.57; 95% CI: 1.16-10.90), and overweight (OR: 1.88; 95% CI: 1.06-3.35) participants were more likely to have hypertension compared with their counterparts.\n\nPolice officers have a high prevalence of significant CVD risk factors such as hypertension, physical inactivity, and being overweight. These findings reinforce the need for interventions addressing the above risk factors to prevent CVD in this population."

    "abstract": "While research on social entrepreneurship and related concepts is steadily increasing, the existing research has over-emphasised the fact that pro-social motive is the primary reason for social entrepreneurs to start social enterprises. Though few studies challenge the pre-existing notion and argue that personal interest can also end up in the creation of social enterprises, the present study tries to understand how these motives evolve and shape over time to convert into social enterprises. By doing so, the study addresses a research gap regarding understanding diverse pathways taken by social entrepreneurs to launch social enterprises. \n\nTo answer the research question, the study adopts a qualitative research design with a narrative approach. The study employs the concept of contextualised life stories to further design the study. Data was collected from four social entrepreneurs in Kerala, India, by using in-depth interviews as this context is not much explored in the literature. \n\nThe study found that the creation of social enterprises is not merely the presence of personal interest or prosocial motives in social entrepreneurs. Rather, it rests on how these interests and motives interact and transition through the influence of triggering events. The study also found that triggering events can either happen naturally or be created. \n\nIdentifying the latter could be useful for relevant stakeholders of social entrepreneurship, ranging from policymakers to practitioners, to create such trigger events to promote more social entrepreneurial activities. Therefore, the study recommends further studies to investigate the triggering events that influence the creation of social enterprises in different contexts."

    "abstract": "Urbanisation is indeed a global trend that is significantly transforming societies and landscapes. India, in particular, has been experiencing rapid urbanisation in recent years, and this is fundamentally changing the country’s social and economic dynamics. However, the state of Kerala, located in the southwestern part of India, stands out for its unique pattern of urbanisation, which is closely aligned with its distinctive topography and socio-economic factors. This study offers a comprehensive examination of urbanisation in Kerala, focusing on its unique spatial and temporal characteristics. \n\nThe spatial analysis of urbanisation in the state reveals that urban development is not concentrated solely within its major cities, but is widespread. These urban clusters align with Kerala’s topographical diversity, with the majority concentrated along the coastal regions in the west, while the eastern highlands of the Western Ghats exhibit fewer urban centres. The state has witnessed a substantial surge in urbanisation rates, with projections anticipating that approximately 68 percent of the population will reside in urban areas by the middle of this century. \n\nUnderstanding these temporal shifts and spatial variations is essential for policymakers and urban planners to effectively address the challenges and opportunities linked to increasing urbanisation."

In contrast to a dominant national imagination of start-ups in India as spaces for the development of novel products with high economic potential, we suggest that start-ups in Kerala exhibit a tendency towards ‘social innovation’, that is, start-ups that are strongly oriented by the goal of addressing particular societal needs in addition to being successful on the market. \n\nDrawing on ethnographic interviews with start-up founders and other related stakeholders, as well as media and documentary analysis, we highlight in this essay key characteristics of social innovation in Kerala, including their reliance on tech-fix approaches. We also highlight the central role of the Kerala Start-up Mission (KSUM), a state-sponsored nodal agency, as a crucial enabler and shaper of the state’s innovation ecosystem. We further suggest that even as this innovation ecosystem is able to address important societal concerns, it nonetheless bypasses underlying social structures that produce them in the first place. \n\nBuilding on the work of sociologist Cornelius Schubert, we argue that it is analytically productive to interpret social innovation in Kerala as an instance of ‘disruptive maintenance’."

    "abstract": "A growing number of studies have linked the incidence of leptospirosis with the occurrence of flood events. Nevertheless, the interaction between flood and leptospirosis has not been extensively studied to understand the influence of flood attributes in inducing new cases. \n\nThis study reviews leptospirosis cases in relation to multiple flood occurrences in Kerala, India. Leptospirosis data were obtained for three years: 2017 (non-flood year) and two years with flooding—2018 (heavy flooding) and 2019 (moderate flooding). We considered the severity of flood events using the discharge, duration and extent of each flooding event and compared them with the leptospirosis cases. The distribution of cases regarding flood discharge and duration was assessed through descriptive and spatiotemporal analyses, respectively. Furthermore, cluster analyses and spatial regression were completed to ascertain the relationship between flood extent and the postflood cases. \n\nThis study found that postflood cases of leptospirosis can be associated with flood events in space and time. The total cases in both 2018 and 2019 increased in the post-flood phase, with the increase in 2018 being more evident. Unlike the 2019 flood, the flood of 2018 is a significant spatial indicator for postflood cases. \n\nOur study shows that flooding leads to an increase in leptospirosis cases, and there is stronger evidence for increased leptospirosis cases after a heavy flood event than after a moderate flooding event. Flood duration may be the most important factor in determining the increase in leptospirosis infections."

    "abstract": "While the role of education in fostering social stability and increasing a country’s human capital is well recognised, there are debates on policies and institutional arrangements in this regard. In particular, parents’ choice of schools appears to be a critical issue as it can influence both educational outcomes and inclusiveness. Given that there is a broader homogeneity in infrastructure facilities available at both household and school levels, one would expect that household-related factors will influence the choice of schooling of children. This article examines such household-level factors that influence households’ choice of schools for children in selected areas of Kottayam District, Kerala. \n\nA primary survey was conducted in December 2021 comprising 300 households. \n\nBased on the results of the estimated binary logit and probit models, this article reports that the choice of school for children is significantly influenced by households’ ethnic background and economic status, and sex, education, and primary occupation of the family head. There is a higher likelihood of choosing public schools by households from the Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe category, those living below the poverty line, or those with agriculture as the primary occupation. On the contrary, this likelihood is less for households with educated and male heads. \n\nHowever, the choice of school for children does not differ significantly between rural and urban households. Further, there is no gender inequality in choosing schools. The findings suggest that future government policies should emphasise infrastructure development and quality improvement in government schools to promote socio-economic inclusion in education."

    "abstract": "This article explores numerous socio-economic facets of internal migrants from West Bengal, including their subjective conceptions of their social standing and social class, and analyses how these facets are intimately tied to growth in Kerala. \n\nIn Kerala, a sizeable portion of internal migrants come from North India. With approximately 2.5 million internal migrants in 2013 and a population growth of 235,000 annually, Kerala is a preferred destination state for migrant labourers in India. Migrant workers from outside have grown to be a significant and essential component of the Kerala economy as a result of the state’s demographic shifts and high rates of educated unemployment, which has led to a severe labour shortage for low-wage frontline jobs. Due to the extreme labour scarcity, the state’s unorganised industries are seeing exceptionally high pay rates. Most migrants come from impoverished and marginalised communities and are employed in the state’s unorganised sector. These migrants frequently find themselves on the periphery of society despite being essential to the economy. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic led to job losses worsening the situation for migrant workers. \n\nThe article examines the position of migrants in West Bengal, the source state, and Kerala, the destination state. Further, the article explores the governance of labour migration within the context of migration policies adopted in Kerala and examines how the term ‘guest workers’, which is used to describe internal migrants, can be seen as a distinct, complicated social dynamic in and of itself."

    "abstract": "This article is an attempt to examine the salient features of a lower caste revolt began in Kerala in the nineteenth century. It was led by Narayana Guru (1854–1928), a spiritual leader with a distinctive urge to break free from the rules of pollution demarcated by Brahmins in the practice of knowledge. \n\nI argue that in the wake of this movement, a strong assertion of community was represented by the Ezhava, a caste which suffered pollution in Hinduism. The defining characteristic of this community today is that of a class—the OBC. In the existing lacunae of non-governmental categories to define the nature of this community, and the philosophy of Advaita remaining an impediment rather than an empowerment to expand the central notions of his thought, I argue that the transition from caste to community represented by Narayana Guru can no longer be situated in the discourse either of Sanskritization or of subalternity, but of the use of technologies of deification."

    "abstract": "Background: Palliative care is the care of patients who have progressive, life-threatening illnesses and who are facing death in the foreseeable future. Since there is a growing need for pharmacist’s intervention in palliative care and there is a gap in the education of palliative care for pharmacy students, this study aims to identify roles and services that have to be performed by palliative care pharmacists in medication-related areas and also to formulate an add-on course to train pharmacy graduates.\n\nMaterials and Methods: A prospective interventional study was done in the palliative care centre in Perinthalmanna, Kerala, India. Relevant data were pooled and analysed for drug-related problems. Necessary interventions were made. Results were interpreted and an add-on course for the training of pharmacy graduates was formulated.\n\nResults: A total of 88 patients were included in the study. The most prevalent conditions in our palliative setting were kidney disease, liver disease, cancer and stroke. Notably, 38 and 10 cases were found to have drug interactions and drug duplications, respectively. Four patients required dosage adjustments. Fifty cases involved pharmacist intervention which improved the outcome by 80%. At the end of the study, a curriculum was formulated to implement a 3-month add-on course entitled ‘PALLIATIVE PHARMACY’ under the guidance of an Expert committee for training pharmacists and pharmacy students.\n\nConclusion: The study identified that there are various roles a pharmacist must undertake in a palliative setup. The involvement of pharmacists in patients’ treatment helps to prevent drug-related problems to a greater extent. The addition of an integrated course for the management of palliative care patients will help to improve the learning as well as practical skills of pharmacists. Incorporating basic and clinical sciences in the therapeutic course is an effective learning plan."

We explored the potential impact of an AMR curriculum implemented as part of a research project in one of the pharmacy colleges in Kerala, India.\n\nMethods: Data were collected using documentary analysis (minutes of meetings and the AMR curriculum developed) and semi-structured qualitative interviews with key informants face-to-face or via the Zoom platform at the participant's convenience. Anonymised interview transcripts were thematically analysed aided by NVivo 12 software.\n\nResults: We interviewed faculty (n = 4), clinical pharmacists (n = 3), and students (n = 6) involved in the design, implementation, and use of the new curriculum. The development and implementation of the new curriculum was conducted through strategically planned and established methodology with equal involvement from the pharmacy college and the research project team. Challenges in this process included a lack of human resources to take classes, time, limited interactions, and motivation of students during the online classes. Despite this, students who attended the classes agreed that the curriculum introduced them to AMS and AMR concepts which helped them during their clinical postings. They agreed that it would be beneficial if a similar curriculum was implemented in other pharmacy colleges.\n\nConclusion: Learnings from this study would be beneficial for other pharmacy colleges to implement a similar AMR curriculum for training pharmacy students to take key roles in AMS, especially in countries like India where postgraduate training for pharmacists remains limited."

The current study aims to assess the current practices and level of training and education in relation to AMS among pharmacy students from Kerala, India.\n\nMethods: A cross-sectional web-based survey was developed and disseminated among doctor of pharmacy 5th year students and interns from selected pharmacy colleges across Kerala through key informants. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse the responses.\n\nResults: The response rate was 34.8% (157/450). Whilst the majority of respondents (89.8%, 141/157) recalled being taught about antimicrobial resistance (AMR) as part of the pharmacy curricula, 84.7% (133/157) believed they didn't have sufficient knowledge about AMR. Most of the respondents (64.9%, 102/157) had not received any AMS training. Clinical posting in AMS was the preferred mode of training suggested by most respondents. Respondents who audited antimicrobials as part of their clinical postings (77.9%, 88/113) reported their main responsibility was review of patient records for assessing the appropriateness of antimicrobials (68.2%, 60/88). Inappropriate selection of antimicrobials was the most common error identified by respondents (38.1%, 43/113) and the key method of communicating their recommendation was informing the prescriber in person (46%, 52/113).\n\nConclusion: Whilst pharmacy students are reviewing antimicrobial prescriptions as part of their clinical postings, their education and training in AMR and AMS remain low. The inclusion of practical clinical training for pharmacy students as part of their curricula can be a cost-effective way to promote AMS initiatives."

    "abstract": "Mullu Kuruman tribes majorly reside in the Wayanad district of Kerala, India. Their dietary practices and food systems are deeply intertwined with wild and underutilised plants, but modern interventions and globalisation have altered them. Therefore, understanding their traditional ecological knowledge regarding the plants used for food and medicine is important for biodiversity conservation and the sustainability of the resources. \n\nThis study, therefore, explores traditional ecological knowledge of the diversity of wild plant use among 125 respondents from the Mullu Kuruman tribe. Data was collected through semi-structured interviews in Malayalam during household visits and walks in gardens and forests. \n\nThis study documents 111 plant species across 85 genera and 42 botanical families. Most of these plants were used for food (66.66 %), while 26.13 % were used for medicinal purposes. <i>Bambusa bambos</i> recorded the highest Use Report (281), Cultural Importance Index (2.248), Relative Importance Index (1), Use Value (2.248), and Cultural Value Index (1.327). \n\nThis study shows the rich diversity of the plants used by the Mullu Kurumans, which is important for their food security and resilience. The agroecological diversity of climate-resilient crops such as <i>Eleusine coracana</i>, <i>Panicum sumatrense</i>, and <i>Sorghum bicolor</i> is suitable for dryland agriculture. Leafy vegetables such as <i>Alternanthera sessilis</i>, and <i>Basella rubra</i>, and fruits such as <i>Artocarpus incisus</i>, <i>Canavalia brasiliensis</i>, and <i>Ziziphus oenopolia</i> which are rich in minerals and vitamins can enhance their health and well-being. Using carbohydrate-rich plants such as <i>Dioscorea</i> spp., <i>Amorphophallus paeonifoliius</i>, and <i>Colacasia esculenta</i> contributes to their food security. \n\nThese insights are crucial for sustainable species use and conservation. This and similar studies from other parts of the world offer new insights into the use of local agro-ecological diversity of plants by the tribal communities to deal with climate change and food security challenges."

The primary objective is to discern food security characteristics among female migrant workers (FMWs) returning to Kerala from Gulf countries, particularly under heightened social and economic uncertainties shared with male migrant workers (MMWs). \n\nThis study conducted in the state of Kerala, India, examines the food security perceptions of Gulf migrants using the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS). Samples of both returning FMWs and MMWs were identified through snowball sampling from the latest Kerala Migrant Survey (KMS) 2018 and Return migrant survey 2021. Oversampling was conducted for return FMWs, otherwise only constituting 20 per cent of the random sample. A total of 1154 samples were collected across all 14 districts in Kerala. \n\nThe analysis indicates that food insecurity was not prevalent among the majority but was significant among a minority of surveyed migrant workers. The results also show that while FMWs experience food insecurity as a lack of access to food variety, MMWs experience food insecurity in the access to food varieties and the absolute quantity of food."

Kerala in India is depicted as a state to be a model for all the third world countries. In this article, through the lens of political economy and ethnographic methods, I would like to see how far it is, true and false. Furthermore, this article looks at how sustainable development practices are implemented to have an impact on climate change.

    "abstract": "Marine fishing is paramount to the provision of sustainable coastal livelihood welfare; especially in the global South. To coastal women, marine fishing avails multiplier social-economic benefits; notably employment, food, and income. Sustaining the innumerable benefits of marine fishing is a conduit towards progressive fisherwomen empowerment and the attainment of transformative ocean sustainability targets. However, in most coastal regions, increasing evidence of human-environmental challenges is blanketing the ability of fisherwomen to benefit from marine fishing and, this is worsened by the perpetuation of social barriers to fisherwomen's inclusion in sustainable coastal fisheries value chains. In addition, there is limited research on how to co-design transformative actions to reduce these challenges partly due to the use of top-down approaches and frameworks that are largely complex and less inclusive. \n\nOur study aims to co-design transformative ocean sustainability narratives to address the complex human-environmental challenges by using local perspectives of coastal fisherwomen. We systematically reviewed 38 documents mainly focusing on marine fisherwomen in Kerala and used a micro-level community participatory approach; involving Focus Group Discussions with 43 fisherwomen in Alappad in Kerala, India. \n\nReview findings revealed that a combination of human-environmental challenges is still prevalent. However, in Alappad, three human-induced systemic barriers predominate: lack of support from people in their own Panchayat, seasonal jobs, and road problem. Through co-designing, fisherwomen in Alappad proposed a novel pathway involving ten steps. This revealed that coastal fisherwomen can identify key systemic challenges that hinder their empowerment and promotion of sustainable ocean practices. \n\nUsing perspectives and narratives of local fisherwomen could be key in breaking systemic barriers to fisherwomen inclusion in not only fishing but also, in other coastal areas and/or sectors and thus could help in developing collaborative ocean sustainability and governance interventions."

    "abstract": "The Central Kerala coast in Southwest India serves as a valuable natural archive for studies of the Late Quaternary coastal evolution, palaeoclimate, and maritime trades. The coast is an archeologically and culturally significant region in South India, located in the mouth of the longest river in Kerala, the Periyar River. The riverbank of the Periyar at its mouth is believed to host the ancient port Muziris, whose remnants are found in the areas around where the Periyar River joins the Arabian Sea. Sea level oscillations and climate variabilities in the past have played a pivotal role in the destruction of the Muziris port. Recent excavations unearthed many artifacts from nearby areas of the river confluence; however, the exact location of the port remains unresolved. \n\nThe present study is an attempt to trace out the coastal evolutionary processes and palaeoclimatic conditions that prevailed in the area during the Late Quaternary period using three drilled cores retrieved from this stretch of the coastal lands. A multi-proxy approach, combining geochemical, mineralogical, palynological, and geochronological tools was used in the study. \n\nThe Holocene deposit in the study area is composed mainly of sand and clay-dominant sediments that fall within an age range of 1.1–8.1 cal kyr BP, whereas the underlying sedimentary sequence dates to a maximum of 31.5–37.9 cal kyr BP. The inorganic and organic elemental compositions, together with the textural and palynological attributes, indicate that Holocene sedimentation occurred here under fluctuating environmental conditions with significant changes in climate and sea level positions. The upper part of this section bears the signature of the humid depositional environment that prevailed during the Late Holocene when sand-dominated sediments were deposited and brought in under the influence of longshore drift. The sediments from the lower part of the section carry the signature of the Holocene transgression when deposition took place under submerged conditions with considerable marine influence but receiving significant terrestrial inputs. \n\nThe study highlights the location of the historically significant lost ancient port of Muziris at Kodungallur near the mouth of the Periyar River. A three-fold evolutionary model proposed for the coastal segment revealed that the location of the Muziris port was part of the Periyar River near Kodungallur, as mentioned by the historians, and the settlement near Pattanam may be considered a satellite township of the ancient Muziris port."

Soil organic carbon stocks (SOC) at the surface (0–30 cm) were higher, 9.10 t C ha−1 and 7.49 k t C ha−1 in forest soils of Chikmagaluru and Idukki, respectively, and the subsurface (30–100 cm) SOC stocks were higher in the coffee plantation ecosystems, 9.11, 9.87, and 8.41 t C ha−1, respectively, in Chikmagaluru, Wayanad, and Idukki. \n\nVulnerability analysis revealed that Chikmagaluru forest (0.57) and coffee (0.51), Wayanad forest (0.58) and coffee (0.55) land uses were low, and both the land uses in Idukki were medium in the status of land degradation with scores of 0.65 and 0.60, respectively, in forest and coffee ecosystems. \n\nThe difference in the status of land degradation was mainly because of changes in soil reaction, surface, and subsurface SOC stock. An increase in soil pH, CEC, and available nutrients upon conversion to coffee plantation along with increased subsurface carbon storage have confirmed the restorative properties of coffee land use even after conversion from natural forests."

    "abstract": "'Kerala is different, but not in the way we think.' Economic change in this southern state has fascinated economists. Most studies focused on the state's unusual human development, asked how a poor and economically stagnant state could achieve high levels of education and healthcare and pointed to politics and government policy to answer the question. Little of that scholarship took history seriously. History, this book says, shows that the foundations of human development were laid before the formation of the state and were owed to many factors besides politics. The striking thing about the state is its unusual income growth, which has been faster than most states since the 1990s. The question the authors ask is, 'How could an income-poor state break out of stagnation so dramatically?' The answers consider past globalisation, labour mobility, a legacy of welfare spending, and the positive ways these features interacted since India's economic reforms."

This study aimed to assess the self-medication practices in rural and urban areas of Ernakulam district, India exploring the prevalence patterns and predictors.\n\nMethods: In this cross-sectional study was done from January to July 2023 among adults aged>=18 years using multistage cluster sampling, 400 urban and 240 rural participants were surveyed. Data were collected using a pre-tested structured interview schedule on demographics and three months of self-medication details. Binary logistic regression analysis was done to find out the factors associated with self-medication.\n\nResults: Self-medication prevalence was 56.9 % [95 % confidence interval (CI) 50.7–58.6 %], higher in rural (61.3 %, 95 % CI 54.8–67.4 %) than urban areas (50.8 %, 95 % CI 45.7–55.8 %). Fever was the primary symptom for rural self-medication (44.8 %), and headache (36 %) in urban areas (36 %). Challenges in accessing doctors led participants to self-medicate; pharmacies were the main source, and commonly used medications were antipyretics and analgesics. Adults aged≤48 years (aOR 2.31, 95 % CI 1.22–4.35, p = 0.010), those who were married (aOR 3.11, CI 1.54–6.26, p = 0.001), and belonging to below poverty line (aOR = 8.03, 95 % CI 3.14–20.54, p < 0.001) were more likely to report self-medication compared to their counter parts in rural areas. In urban areas, only younger age (aOR 3.13, 95 % CI 1.78–5.50, p < 0.001) was significant.\n\nConclusion: More than half of the participants in urban and rural areas reported self-medication in our study. Efforts are warranted to reduce self-medication practices in the community."

    "abstract": "The livestock sector is experiencing continuous global growth, projected to surge by 60–70 per cent by 2050, with developing countries bearing the brunt of this expansion. This trend strongly suggests that the demand for and supply of feed and fodder in developing nations must increase proportionally to avoid a crisis. However, severe data scarcity hampers efforts to determine what and how much to produce. This situation is mirrored in the Indian state scenario, including Kerala. \n\nThis paper addresses these challenges by analysing the dynamics of feed and fodder demand and supply in Kerala, utilising a blend of primary and secondary data. It examines the unique characteristics and likely reasons behind them, contrasting Kerala's situation with that of other developing countries. \n\nThe findings reveal a deficit in feed and fodder supply in the state, reflecting broader trends in developing countries, albeit with a surplus of green fodder. The study also delves into the determinants of agricultural income for animal-rearing farmers in Kerala, highlighting distinct social dimensions. \n\nConsidering these insights, the study recommends critical policy interventions to address the feed and fodder deficit, emphasising the potential for leveraging indigenous approaches to mitigate the shortfall."

    "abstract": "Climate change mitigation is a global imperative, necessitating multifaceted efforts from various sectors. This paper digs into civil society's critical role in mitigating climate change, focusing on the ways that civil society organisations empower communities, advocate for policy reforms, and implement grassroots projects. The goal of this study is to thoroughly examine civil society's various contributions to climate change mitigation and provide conclusions that can guide more effective collaboration strategies.  The study's fundamental research topic is the need to understand the exact mechanisms by which civil society plays a crucial role in climate change mitigation. This includes their involvement in community empowerment, public awareness campaigns, legislative advocacy, and the of sustained programs. The study intends to offer light on the particular characteristics of civil society in stimulating climate action by exploring these aspects. \n\nThis study adopts a mixed-methods approach in its methodology in Ernakulam district, Kerala. It entails doing a qualitative analysis of case studies to examine the numerous ways in which civil society organisations work to mitigate climate change. Quantitative data are also collected to analsze the impact of their activities on policy reforms, community participation, and climate resilience. \n\nCivil society encourages communities to take ownership of climate action through education, capacity-building, and resource allocation, supporting sustainable practices at the grassroots level. The study further demonstrates that civil society plays a significant part in holding the government to account regarding their climate guarantees. Their activities, such as renewable energy projects and sustainable agriculture practices, generate community-led solutions that help to accomplish global climate targets while additionally enhancing local resilience. Furthermore, civil society promotes collaboration among the commercial sector, governments, and communities, leading to a more inclusive approach to climate change mitigation. \n\nThese insights may assist policymakers, stakeholders, and civil society organisations develop more effective climate change mitigation strategies, thereby ensuring a sustainable and resilient future."

Information on physical activity (PA), sedentary behaviour, fruit and vegetable intake, sleep, and alcohol and tobacco use was collected using questionnaires. Blood pressure, waist circumference, 2-h plasma glucose, high-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides were measured using standardised protocols. Latent class analysis was used to identify clusters of health behaviours, and multilevel mixed-effects linear regression was employed to examine their associations with cardiometabolic risk factors. \n\nResults: Two classes were identified, with 87.4% of participants in class 1 and 12.6% in class 2. Participants in both classes had a high probability of not engaging in leisure-time PA (0.80 for class 1; 0.73 for class 2) and consuming <5 servings of fruit and vegetables per day (0.70 for class 1; 0.63 for class 2). However, participants in class 1 had a lower probability of sitting for >=3 h per day (0.26 vs 0.42), tobacco use (0.10 vs 0.75), and alcohol use (0.08 vs 1.00) compared to those in class 2. Class 1 had a significantly lower mean systolic blood pressure (β = −3.70 mm Hg, 95% confidence interval [CI] −7.05, −0.36), diastolic blood pressure (β = −2.45 mm Hg, 95% CI −4.74, −0.16), and triglycerides (β = −0.81 mg/dL, 95% CI −0.75, −0.89). \n\nConclusion: Implementing intervention strategies, tailored to cluster-specific health behaviours, is required for the effective prevention of cardiometabolic disorders among high-risk adults for type 2 diabetes."

Information on quality of life (36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36)), psychological distress (distress thermometer), and the familial, interpersonal, social, and community impacts of cancer (semi-structured interview guide) were elicited. Linear regression was used to identify the factors associated with distress and the factors were explored further using thematic analysis.\n\nResults: Patients included in the study (n = 130; mean age 57.5 years) had moderate or mild (66.9%) to severe (25.4%) distress. Concerns about work (93%), difficulty in; home care and housing (82%), care for dependents (65%), unempathetic family (87.6%), isolation (70%), and body image (65%) were major reasons for their distress. Physiological, social, and family-related stressors among the respondents included challenges in physical functioning, intense physical symptoms like fatigue, loss of appetite and sleep, role restrictions, alterations in family responsibilities, functional dependency, inadequate family support, challenges in social and interpersonal interactions, and an unsupportive work environment.\n\nConclusion: Cancer is a health crisis that involves psychological, social, and economic distress, compelling professionals to design multifaceted individualized care packages rather than only concentrating on medical management to alleviate their distress."

I further argue that the glorification and magnification of voluntary involvement of men in care work further problematize the dichotomy. \n\nI construe that the egalitarian gender perspectives expressed by the respondents are premised on the concept of gender equality as something to be achieved outside the family, and not within. Here, I illustrate how the working wives and mothers are compelled to over-compensate for ideas of femininity and motherliness associated with the figure of the housewife, through this imposed volunteering of care work."

    "abstract": "Kerala, the Indian state with the highest reported level of social development, faces a challenge with persistent early marriage, particularly among Muslims in Malappuram. This study explores the sociocultural factors influencing this situation, in which child marriage rates among Muslims are significantly higher than those of Hindus and Christians. \n\nEmploying a qualitative research strategy within a specific Malappuram <i>mahallu</i>, a Muslim-majority village cluster encompassing three villages, we identify a multifaceted interplay of micro and macro forces perpetuating early marriage. Lack of social networks, stemming from limited higher education options and career opportunities, restricts girls’ choices and makes them susceptible to parental pressure to marry early. \n\nParents, on the other hand, often view early marriage as an appropriate solution to their anxieties concerning parental responsibility, dowry, and family honour. This pressure is amplified by the narrative promoted by religious leaders who portray early marriage as the ideal path. This narrative, in turn, resonates with a subset of young men, particularly temporary Gulf migrants who prefer to marry adolescent girls, thereby perpetuating the cycle. \n\nWe also argue that, unlike most regions in India, poverty and illiteracy are not the primary drivers of early marriage among Muslims in Malappuram."

    "abstract": "While the representation of the fat body in post-millennial mainstream South Indian films has often been problematic due to the inherent biases against non-normative bodies, a promising trend has been visible in recent post-millennial South Indian movies centered on fat protagonists. Known as “fat films” within fat activism for their stance on fat positivity and fat acceptance, these movies claim to promote liberatory discourses regarding fat bodies. \n\nHowever, we argue that the liberatory potential of these movies often becomes limited due to the structurally similar, formulaic plots that construct fatness as a liminal, alterable state of being. \n\nFor our analysis, we have chosen three mainstream South Indian “fat films” released in three different Indian languages in which the narratives navigate through the complex life experiences of the fat protagonists: <i>Da Thadiya</i> (Hey Fatso) (2012), a Malayalam movie directed by Ashiq Abu; <i>Inji Iduppazhagi</i> (Size Zero) (2015), a Tamil movie directed by Prakash Kovelamudi; and <i>Laddu Babu</i> (2014) a Telugu movie directed by Ravi Babu. \n\nIt is found that the subversive potential of these films is undermined by a host of issues, both specific and general, such as (a) their construction of fatness as an abject form of embodiment where it becomes a constant source of laughter, (b) their reductive and redundant portrayals of fat subjectivities and inability to contribute alternative narratives which aren’t centered on the fat protagonists’ “eternal” conflict with their bodies, and (c) their inability to interrogate the larger body politics behind the aestheticisation of certain bodies as normative."

The study aims to assess the effect of an Environmental Education Program (EEP) based on empathy, reflective thinking, and information on preadolescents’ environmental values and knowledge. \n\nFor that, a non-equivalent control group design was used. Data collection was done through questionnaires, checklists, and participant thought diaries. Forty-six students (eleven-to-twelve-year-old children) selected through purposive sampling from the sixth standard of two semi-urban schools in Kerala, India, constituted the sample. In the intervention, empathy was manipulated through stories and empathy exercises, reflective thinking through thought diaries, and information on environmental phenomena, issues, and the effect of human actions through stories and knowledge exercises. \n\nEmpathy, reflective thinking, and information manipulations positively influenced the participants’ environmental values and knowledge, and the effect manifested in cognitive, affective, and conative dimensions. \n\nThe study has implications for conducting Environmental Education indoors effectively by integrating affective, cognitive, and metacognitive approaches. Empathy stories can be utilised to address various environmental phenomena and issues. Reflective thinking on environmental phenomena and issues can be applied to teach appropriate environmental behaviors."

    "abstract": "Indian classical dance uses a variety of non-verbal communication devices, with gestures called <i>hasta</i> or <i>mudra</i> being one of the most ancient sign languages powerful to transmit the meaning of the lyrics through dance. The classical dance forms of Kerala have an elaborate scheme of gestures drawn from the ancient text on aesthetic sign language, called <i>Hastalaksanadipika<i>, inspired by the Vedic, Natya and Tantric traditions. \n\nThe following is an attempt to document a performance-oriented, socially inclusive effort that makes Indian traditional dance performance discernible to the Deaf and Hard of Hearing (DHH) community, a disparate group that is hardly considered as a spectator during performance creation by mainstream Indian classical dancers. \n\nThe Indian Sign Language (ISL) of individuals with hearing impairments is elaborate, yet is rarely used as a gestural language along with other aesthetic gestural sign languages to disseminate a narrative in a work of art. \n\nIn her role as both creator and performer, Methil Devika creates work in Mohiniyattam, a graceful dance form of Kerala, integrating the sign language of those with hearing impairments along with the gestural language prescribed in the ancient treatise <i>Hastalaksanadipika<i>. She applies it strategically in her work of art, as an interlinking tool between the art and the audience. In the first few moments, “all walls came crumbling down,” something the performer quotes in the visual documentation of the work. Any separation between the hearing impaired and the artiste, as well as the spectators, become inconsequential. \n\nThe performance and the presentation have been video documented in a film called <i>The Crossover</i>, and the following is an attempt to describe the creative process."

    "abstract": "Purpose: Impaired mother-infant bonding (MIB) is associated with inadequate maternal skills and pose a higher risk for impaired learning, child abuse, and psychiatric disorders in children. There are approximately 24 million births annually in India; however, community data on MIB from India is lacking.\n\nMethods: The study reports the findings of a cross-sectional survey of 8,189 mothers with children of age between 13 and 15 months from the state of Kerala. Bonding was assessed using the Mother–infant bonding scale (MIBS). Other correlates assessed include obstetric and birth history, chronic pain, postpartum depression, and temperamental issues in the infant.\n\nResults: The prevalence of impaired MIB in our sample was 12.3%. Those in extended/joint family, experiencing postpartum complications, supplementary breastfeeding in the first 6 months, postpartum depression and temperamental issues in infant were found to be associated with increased MIBS scores in a multivariate mixed-effect zero-inflated poisson model.\n\nConclusion: Experience of impaired MIB is not uncommon among mothers in India. More needs to be done to explore these issues, especially among those with higher risk to ensure appropriate interventions to mitigate long-term consequences."

A comparative case study methodology was used to document each clinic’s MHAT services and activities, as found during field visits and interviews with staff members and volunteers.\n\nFindings: The study shows that all four clinics met the basic aim of providing free, quality mental health care to the poorest populations, although not all aspects of the comprehensive model could be equally provided. Alignment with the MHAT vision, appropriate leadership, the relationship with partners and their level of community engagement determined the varied success between clinics.\n\nOriginality/value: The current study evaluation stresses that community ownership is crucial. Careful attention must be paid to the characteristics of selected partners, including their leadership styles and ability to garner resources."

It looks at translation as a social and cultural act that transcribes, articulates and interprets structures of power unfolding within asymmetrical fields of cultural politics. \n\nThe book tries to go beyond traditional approaches that consider translation as a literary and linguistic endeavour, attempting to look at it as a process that transcribes and articulates the region of Kerala, while teasing out the paradoxes, ambiguities and politics that mediate such translational acts. \n\nThe chapters in this book delve into seminal issues, ranging from the politics that constitutes various linguistic variables of Malayalam to the interpretative paradigms that bring out experiences of the gendered and subaltern subject in Kerala. \n\nIn the process, it focuses on texts as varied as the Malayalam translation of <i>Les Misérables</i>, the autobiographies of C. K. Janu and Nalini Jameela, and Ramu Kariat's cinematic adaptation of <i>Chemmeen</i>. \n\nFrom detailed discussions on canonical literary texts to non-canonical/popular cultural texts, the volume pitches translation as an academic and political vantage point that interrogates the writing and the rewriting of the region in diverse ways. It destabilises the hierarchies between texts and their 'afterlives', texts and their contexts, and texts and their subjects. \n\n<i>Translating Kerala</i> will be of interest to academics and readers interested in translation studies, cultural studies, gender studies and Kerala studies."

The study discusses the construct of masculinity in Malayalam cinema over the decades concerning these films and investigates the hegemonic maintenance of masculinity based on Connell’s <i>Masculinities</i>. \nUnderstanding masculinity as a construct relies on the ‘complete man’ image of Shammi, Govind, and Vishal. \n\nThe study also identifies the diverse masculinities in the films to examine the concept’s inclusive nature. The two varied treatments of masculinity, (1) as madness and (2) as crime, based on Foucault’s <i>Madness and Civilization</i>, explore the masculinising gendered spaces of public, private, and domestic. \n\nThese movies analyse the two patterns of violence put forth by Connell: (1) one is the physical verbal violence that the privileged group uses to sustain their dominance, and (2) that claims masculinity among men in group struggles."

The purpose of this study is to present a comprehensive assessment of the determinants affecting land value in the Indian city of Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala. \n\nDesign/methodology/approach: The global influence of the identified 20 explanatory variables on land value is measured using the traditional hedonic price modeling approach. The localised spatial variations of the influencing parameters are examined using the non-parametric regression method, geographically weighted regression. This study used advertised land value prices collected from Web sources and screened through field surveys. \n\nFindings: Global regression results indicate that access to transportation facilities, commercial establishments, crime sources, wetland classification and disaster history has the strongest influence on land value in the study area. Local regression results demonstrate that the factors influencing land value are not stationary in the study area. Most variables have a different influence in Kazhakootam and the residential areas than in the central business district region. \n\nOriginality/value: This study confirms findings from previous studies and provides additional evidence in the spatial dynamics of land value creation. It is to be noted that advanced modelling approaches used in the research have not received much attention in Indian property valuation studies. The outcomes of this study have important implications for the property value fixation of urban Kerala. The regional variation of land value within an urban agglomeration shows the need for a localised method for land value calculation."

    "abstract": "<i>Kerala’s Pulluvas and Pampum Tullal<.i> is a story about the lives of Kerala’s Pulluva ritual specialists and their days-long ritual performance, pampum tullal, or the ‘jumping dance’ of the serpent deities (<i>nagam</i> or <i>pampu</i>). \n\nThe ritual is commissioned by members of Kerala’s landed communities to bring health and prosperity to their extended families. Belonging to an ancient South Indian tradition, the ritual is orchestrated by Pulluva ritual specialists, who hold the sole hereditary right to perform it. \n\nThis book is the first in Kerala to approach this ritual tradition from the viewpoints and agency of its Dalit (formerly known as ‘untouchable’) ritual specialists—men and women, and to examine Pulluva ritual practice in the context of rapid and extensive social change. \n\nThe study sheds important light upon Pulluva rituals, lives, and livelihoods, within the broader contexts of changing class, caste, and kinship relations; land tenure and ritual patronage; labour migration; and the decline of Nayar matrilineality and old landed families. These wide-ranging social trends, indexed and acted out in ritual, are the backdrop for understanding Pulluva ritual practice from the 1980s, and in terms of history, point to multiple structures and hierarchies of practice and meaning. \n\nThe combination of the focused study of ritual performance and traditional ethnography allows readers to witness the ritual practices and lives of members of a small, real-world community rendered virtually absent from the historical record. It’s extraordinary to hear from Pulluvas in their own words and to witness their dedication to their sacred profession, at a time when the world they knew was rapidly falling apart. But thirty-plus years later, the story—at least for now, has a happy ending; both Pulluvas and <i>pampum tullal</i> are thriving."

    "abstract": "This article examines the formation of minority subjectivity in the cultural public sphere of Kerala, South India by analysing the case of a famous singer from Kerala, Kattassery Joseph Yesudas or K. J. Yesudas. The singer’s popularity is punctuated by the shifts and ruptures in the music industry in Malayalam – the standard language of the region. This analysis elucidates the historical premises wherein aesthetic judgments shape discourses of identity politics and cultural legitimacy. Therefore, it focuses on the singer’s cult image and the visual manifestations of his voice. In doing so, this article attends to the many layers of the unparalleled popularity Yesudas enjoys. This analysis explores how a specific idea of secularism is foundational in the singer’s popularity and proposes that the idea of sacrifice plays a crucial role within. Clearly, Yesudas’s colossal status is predicated on an idea of performance and this performance is embodied in a perennial sacrifice of the self. Further, the article argues that Yesudas’s popularity and the trajectory of minority politics in Kerala is crucial in the erasure of ‘other’ voices from the domain of popular music in the region."

The release of a series of YouTube videos in India particularly in Kerala represents distinct response to the Rap music culture. In distinct yet interlocked ways these videos signal a changing musical culture in Kerala, one that is enabled by new networks and a rapidly changing techno social soundscape and its accompanying listening practices and music culture. This article is an attempt to map and analyze these practices through the video texts of some of these hip hop videos, websites and interviews with the artists and key actors. It analyzes the post globalization musical cultures in Kerala, mapping its techno-social and aesthetic practices and how they bear upon listening practices. It also maps the meaning of rap and hip hop in the Indian sub continent and its relationship to power and hegemony in the musical soundscape of Kerala. The article tries to theorize the emergence of a rap music video culture in Kerala and the Internet publics through the debates on public sphere and how they are caught up with questions of historical memory and identity."

    "abstract": "The Sabarimala Temple in the South Indian state of Kerala garnered national and global attention following violent protests against the Indian Supreme Court’s verdict in September 2018, allowing the entry of women of menstruating age to the temple. By studying popular Malayalam films released over the years, this article examines how beliefs around Sabarimala are intrinsically linked to the notion of the male householder, while simultaneously marginalizing women’s religiosity. \n\nWe first delineate the influence of the film Swami Ayyappan (1975) in establishing the role of the deity Ayyappa in the welfare of hetero-patriarchal families in Kerala. The second section studies how the film Chinthavishtayaya Shyamala (1998) problematizes the centrality of the male householder in Kerala after liberalization and the way that the Sabarimala pilgrimage is used within the narrative to reinstate the patriarchal male. \n\nThe following section examines the film The Great Indian Kitchen (2021) against the backdrop of the Sabarimala protests and developments in gender regimes in Kerala post-2000. Poised at the intersections of gender and religion, we argue that this film unravels the subtle forms of everyday gender discrimination and the undesirability of patriarchal masculinity in contemporary Kerala. \n\nIt concludes by discussing briefly a few other recent Malayalam films, like Malikappuram (2022), released after the women’s temple-entry protests, to show their treatment of the Sabarimala issue and the politics of gender therein."

The book is the result of research that spans over two decades and some of the materials in it had already been published as articles. The book positions the evolution of the struggles and consciousness of the subaltern sections via the left movement in Kerala in the debate between Vivek Chibber and theorists from the subaltern studies collective. With multiple pieces of evidences from the history of the communist movement in Kerala, it mounts an elaborate criticism of dichotomies advanced in subaltern studies between the subaltern and modernity, tradition and modernity, and modernity and democracy as it evolved mainly through the works of Partha Chatterjee and Dipesh Chakrabarty."

    "abstract": "This article analyses the meanings, practices and socio-historical contexts of kudumbayogams (family associations) among the large, relatively prosperous, multi-denominational community of Syrian Christians in Kerala, who are today spread across the globe. Kudumbayogams present new ways of mobilising and displaying family, kinship and community ties. The article argues that while earlier socio-economic shifts inaugurated the spatial dispersal and reconstitution of Syrian Christian patrilineal families and households, they also led to the formation of family associations, alongside other modern associational forms. Based on a detailed analysis of printed family histories, and allied documents, this study conceptualises kudumbayogam as a modern fortification of attempts to resolve the ambiguities of changing times by tethering a Christian brand of upper-caste social conservatism with ‘neoliberal’ individualism. This modern fortification mobilises households and families through an array of structures and activities that seek to foster cultural continuity, communication, conflict resolution and charity among its members. In the process, kudumbayogams actively blunt intra-group contradictions and highlight inter-group differences."

One set of activists repudiates community ties and resists normative pressures; for them, environmental justice becomes a way of transcending all local identities and affiliations, even humanity itself. Other activists seek to ground their activism in community belonging, to fight for their own people. Each approach produces its own dilemmas and offers its own insights into ethical tensions we all face between taking a stand and standing with others. \n\nIn sharing Kerala activists’ diverse stories, <i>Uncommon Cause</i> offers a fresh perspective on environmental ethics, showing that environmentalism, even as it looks beyond merely human concerns, is still fundamentally about how we relate to other people."

Most of these congregations were Ashkenazi, as the first Sephardic synagogue was not estab-lished in Toronto until 1958 and was still quite small in the 1960s. However, many Indian Jews were uncomfortable attending Ashkenazi synagogues, despite the fact that in India they were an English- speaking community.\n\nAlmost immediately, Indian Jews had people question their Indian Jewish identities. Ashkenazi Jews demanded that Indian Jews explain how they could be Jewish, on the basis of their “brown” skin color, and how they had become Jewish. Ashkenazim were further confused by the fact that Indian Jews claimed to be Jewish and yet were unfamiliar with Ashkenazi foods and Yiddish phrases. Indian Jews found the persistence and tone of these questions to be marginalizing, exclusionary, and racist."

    "abstract": "The phenomenon of custodial grandparents has increased in South Asia and elsewhere, partly due to the growing trend of parents migrating for work, but often because of the untimely demise of one or both parents, illness, alcoholism and related issues affecting the birth parents. \n\nAdopting a phenomenological lens, this article explores the lived experiences and perceived needs of 10 custodial grandmothers from the Attappadi indigenous belt in Kerala to discuss how they cope with multiple challenges. Data gathering through indigenous storytelling methods and an interpretive phenomenological analysis points to new forms of feminisation of caregiving through custodial grandparenting, which require further research. \n\nWithin the complex socio-economic and health contexts of the selected sample, our fieldwork explores the implications of the absence of the middle generation, which creates a network of intersecting disadvantages. \n\nWe argue that the resulting calls for better support networks to assist these indigenous custodial grandmothers need to be addressed effectively at the levels of policy and practice."

    "abstract": "Recent debates highlight that agriculture-based strategies can enhance food security. Thus, this article examined the incidence and determinants of food security of agricultural households in Kuttanad, a wetland region situated in the southern part of the state of Kerala in India. \n\nTowards this objective, we have collected food consumption data from households and converted them into an equivalent amount of calorie intake. Further, we define food security in terms of calorie adequacy using the minimum calorie norm of 1,800 kcal suggested by the Food and Agricultural Organization for India. \n\nOur empirical results reveal that 37% of the sample households are food insecure. The incidence of food insecurity is higher among poor sections like labour households, Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY), and Scheduled Castes families. Results of Probit regression show that below poverty line and AAY families are less likely to be food secure than above poverty line families. \n\nThe purchase of cereals from the Public Distribution System is found to have a positive impact on the food security status of the households. Both farm income and non-farm income positively influence the probability of food security. The study concludes that there are impediments to realizing the linkages between agriculture and food security.\nJEL Classification: Q10, Q18, I32, C25"

    "abstract": "Kūṭiyāṭṭam, an ancient form of Sanskrit theater from Kerala, was traditionally performed only in temples by members of two temple assistant castes. Today, however, it has spread to other castes and to venues outside temples. \n\nIt is a fantastically complex, sophisticated, layered performance, toiling at amassing and perfecting ways of materializing a world where gods, demons, and mythical heroes live, bringing the audience into these other realities. \n\nTaking an anthropological approach, <i>Awakening a Living World on a Kūṭiyāṭṭam Stage</i> explores how Kūṭiyāṭṭam uses cultural dynamics, gleaned from temple ritual and theater, to remove the distinctions between mundane reality and the mediaeval plays being performed on stage. \n\nThe unique features of Kūṭiyāṭṭam—makeup masks, enthralling drumming, delivering words in mudrā gestures, a shimmering lamp, male and female actors—all intertwine to animate stories from the great Indian eposes. Analyzing the cultural dynamics at work in Kūṭiyāṭṭam foregrounds a symbolic anthropology in which representation and symbols are shunned, while endless repetitions fill the stage with reverberating somatic intensities of profound depth. \n\nThus, a new kind of living reality emerges that includes the protagonists of the play—gods, demons, humans, animals, and objects—together with the artist, the audience, and beyond."

    "abstract": "In early modern India, and particularly South India—from roughly the sixteenth century until the eighteenth—a new literary vogue emerged in all major literary traditions (Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Sanskrit, Persian). With remarkable salience, we find verses built around absurdity of various kinds and modes. Sometimes it is a matter of pushing the existing literary conventions and figures to an impossible extreme. In other cases, we find a fascination with asymmetry, disjunction, skewed causality, and irrealis or counter-factual linguistic forms. Although such experiments with absurdity have precedents in classical kāvya, the evident consistency and intertextual relations among outlandish poems in this period are very striking, as is the fact that the theoreticians of poetics found it necessary to posit a grammar for them (including for poems based on asat, that is, non-existence or sheer impossibility). This essay explores the forms and logical underpinnings that this fashion for the bizarre assumed; we also offer a tentative explanation for the new trend. The prabandha-based poems of absurdity need to be distinguished from the coded texts known in Kannada as beḍagina vacana and in early Hindi as ulaṭbaṃsi, in which an upside-down or inside-out world is created, the goal being to arrest intellection altogether. We also show the distinction between the poetry of the absurd in the early modern texts and the European Dada movement, which aims at unravelling language and enshrines a principle of pure randomality in the choice of words."

    "abstract": "Background: Previous studies have shown that children and adolescents living with single parents are prone to behavioural and psychological difficulties and experience a poor sense of well-being. Also, the period of adolescence is critical for the development of an individual in multiple aspects; it is important to focus on their well-being and associated factors for a better transition into adulthood.\n\nAims: This study aims to find the mediating role of social competence and emotion regulation on the relationship between resilience and psychological well-being among single-parent adolescents.\n\nMethods: This was a cross-sectional study. The study sample was 385 adolescents residing in Kerala (179 boys and 206 girls, mean age = 15.03, SD = 1.45). A total of 185 participants (48.1%) were from families that lost either of their parents to death, and the other 200 participants (51.9%) were from divorced or separated families. Self-reported measures for resilience, social competence, emotion regulation, and psychological well-being were used for data collection. Data were analysed using IBM SPSS and AMOS version 24.\n\nResults: The results showed that resilience, the prosocial behaviour dimension of social competence, and the cognitive reappraisal dimension of emotion regulation indicate significant positive associations with the psychological well-being of adolescents living in single-parent families. The expressive suppression dimension of emotion regulation and the antisocial behavior dimension of social competence have a substantial negative connection with the psychological well-being of adolescents raised by single parents. The findings suggest that resilience directly predicts psychological well-being; prosocial behaviour and cognitive reappraisal partially mediate the association of resilience and psychological well-being.\n\nConclusion: According to our findings in this study, developing social competence skills and adaptive emotion regulation strategies can improve the psychological well-being of adolescents living with single parents. The results have multiple clinical, educational, and community implications."

It interrogates how Ka Bodyscapes brought to the forefront hitherto unexplored visual dynamics of the gay male body and homoeroticism on screen while troubling the heterosexual dynamics of the Malayalam film industry. By situating this film within the history of representation of male homosexuality in Malayalam cinema and the changing regimes of queer politics and feminist interventions in Kerala in the last decade, the article argues how the film’s radical visual representation of gay sexuality at the intersection of caste and religion problematizes the heterosexual family/state, thereby challenging the patriarchal masculinity that marginalizes women and sexual minorities in Kerala."

It argues that the heroic screen image, dialogue delivery, stylised stunts, and trendsetting costumes introduced by Jayan in the 1970s–1980s established a new reception of the masculine body that glorified the semiotics of the ‘Superman’. \n\nUsing the spectator–spectacle discourse on superstardom, this article examines how different shades of superstardom, especially its posthumous restructuring and reproduction, affect the fate of superheroes in regional cinemas."

In these magazines, the idealisation of Hindu masculinity takes place through presenting Muslims as less progressive / incapable of acquiring ‘modern standards’. In this context, the Hindu emerges as a reformer who helps the Muslim to ‘acquire modernity’. \n\nAlso, children’s science magazines view science as a means for liberation from religion and irrational beliefs through critiquing ‘irrational’ stories in popular Malayalam children’s magazines. But a close examination of science magazines reveals that it is embedded in the very religious ideologies from which it is seeking liberation."

This cultural understanding is important to look at media (and by extension film) through its power dynamics and capital it provides to the groups that it represents and the groups that it does not. \n\nThe study of these representations as being in opposition to each other in the way of ‘in’ and ‘out’ groups to understand the ways in which culture and cinema receive minorities, and for this paper, the Indian Christian identity in India. Mainstream cinema or Bollywood helps in the translation of in and out groups into the ‘othering’ of religious minorities while also presenting and confirming the already existing ideas of the identity of minorities. \n\nThis paper looks to identify the importance of alternative cinema, in this case regional Malayalam Cinema, for minorities that have been marginalised by the media and their role in the repairing the self-image of these minorities. The intrinsic binary between the alternative and mainstream cinema here are representative of the power and lack thereof for these minorities in terms of their social and self-perception.\n\nThis paper goes a step further by not just looking at Indian Christians as a homogeneous whole but also determining the difference in portrayal and representation of the different denominations of the Indian Christian community. Therefore, this paper attempts to explain the reasons for the invisibility of Indian Christian representation or its ‘other-ing’ in mainstream film while also understanding the binary in the internal cultural dynamics within the Christian population through the lens of popular culture and regional or alternative cinema."

Mental health professionals trained in the mainstream western biopsychiatric paradigm are largely silent on the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex and asexual identity discourses as they institute pathological and reductive conceptualization about sexualities, psychosocial disabilities and resultant sufferings. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork carried out at two non-governmental and a governmental CMHP in Kerala, south India, I illustrate the lack of a human rights–based approach to sex and sexual orientation and gender identity, due to which pressing concerns of sexual life are mis/overdiagnosed as mental ‘disorders’ to be treated within a biomedical framework. The lack of an intersectional approach fails the marginalized sexual subjects to exert their agency, develop critical consciousness and recognize sexuality as a political issue—all vital for transformative social change. The consequence is a dehumanized mental health care system that fails to ‘archive feelings’ that are pivotal in making invisibilized worlds observable to tell ‘unwelcome truths’ that induce psychic pain. Collaborative alliances among other marginalised sections like Queer, Dalit, tribal and Crip (disability) groups are vital in resisting intra-individual prescriptions by increasingly commercializing mental health practice in a country beset by a host of social problems including poverty, discrimination and rising inequalities. It is crucial to understand systems of power (imbalance) that operate as major (social) determinants of (sexual) mental health."

    "abstract": "Manchadikkari is a region in central Kerala occupied primarily by Dalit Christian communities. The majority of the people in the area are agricultural daily wage workers who have been economically and culturally marginalised. Caste discrimination and exploitation mark their past and present. The people in Manchadikkari articulate powerful anti-caste politics through their creative cultural productions like songs, stories, and plays that take shape in their community groups. The remembrance and reiteration of caste experiences in these community groups keep alive the history of caste exploitation and transmit these memories to the next generation. \n\nThis paper analyses the play Azhakante Kutil (‘Azhakan’s Hut’), authored by Thankamma Titus from Manchadikkari in 2021 and performed by a group of women who are members of the community group ‘Sanjeevani.’ This study considers the processes of conceptualisation, production, and performance of the play to show how these processes embody anti-caste politics. \n\nThe play dwells on the community’s caste history to show that caste is not an anachronism of the feudal era but actively determines the present cultural and material conditions. When contextualised in the community, the play exists as a moving narrative of the community’s cultural activism."

The study also investigates the monetary factors determining the quality and provision of healthcare infrastructure and manpower for India as a whole as well as for rural and tribal areas discretely, using a panel regression model and the generalised method of moments. \n\nThe results show that economically advanced states, like Haryana and Maharashtra, do not rank highly on the index based on the healthcare infrastructure and manpower indicators; rural states with smaller populations enjoy better healthcare services. Inadequate public health expenditure results in a low ranking on the composite index and is reflected in the high infant mortality rates in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh, though the situation is reversed in Kerala. \n\nThe panel regression model reveals that increased per capita public health expenditure has not translated into improved healthcare infrastructure and manpower in Indian states or tribal regions within those states. The public health expenditure to gross state domestic product ratio is a positively significant predictor of healthcare infrastructure and manpower in rural areas. \n\nThe panel generalised method of moments results confirm that developing targeted healthcare infrastructure and manpower in India as a whole, as well as for rural and tribal areas in the short term, has been poorly realis\ned."

    "abstract": "Dengue shows high geographic heterogeneity within and across endemic countries. In the context of increasing burden and predicted outbreaks due to climate change, understanding the heterogeneity will enable us to develop region specific targeted interventions, including vaccination. World Health Organisation (WHO) suggests standard methodologies to study the burden and heterogeneity at national and subnational levels. Regional studies with robust and standard methodology to capture heterogeneity are scarce. \n\nWe estimated the seroprevalence of dengue in children aged 9–12 years and the force of infection in Kerala, India, from where Zika cases also have been reported recently.\n\nWe conducted a school-based cross-sectional survey in 38 clusters; selected by stratified random sampling, representing rural, urban, high burden and low-burden administrative units. Validation of Indirect IgG ELISA was done by Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test (PRNT90) using the local isolates of all four serotypes. Force of infection (FOI) was estimated using the WHO-FOI calculator. We conducted a follow-up survey among a subsample of seronegative children, to estimate the rate of sero-conversion.\n\nAmong 5236 children tested, 1521 were positive for anti-dengue IgG antibody. The overall seroprevalence in the state was 29% (95% CI 24.1–33.9). The validity corrected seroprevalence was 30.9% in the overall sample, 46.9% in Thiruvananthapuram, 26.9% in Kozhikkode and 24.9% in Kollam. Age-specific seroprevalence increased with age; 25.7% at 9 years, 29.5% at 10 years, 30.9% at 11 years and 33.9% at 12 years. \n\nSeroprevalence varied widely across clusters (16.1%–71.4%). The estimated force of infection was 3.3/100 person-years and the seroconversion rate was 4.8/100 person-years. 90% of children who tested positive were not aware of dengue infection. All the four serotypes were identified in PRNT and 40% of positive samples had antibodies against multiple serotypes.\n\nThe study validates the WHO methodology for dengue serosurveys and confirms its feasibility in a community setting. The overall seroprevalence in the 9–12 year age group is low to moderate in Kerala; there are regional variations; high burden and low burden clusters co-exist in the same districts. The actual burden of dengue exceeds the reported numbers. Heterogeneity in prevalence, the high proportion of inapparent dengue and the hyperendemic situation suggest the need for region-specific and targeted interventions, including vaccination."

This research attempts to propose a model for assessing stakeholder satisfaction and project significant factors that need to be considered when determining the performance of a conservation project, taking the Thiruvananthapuram Fort Area, India as a case example. \n\nThe study employed a mixed-method approach of using expert consultations, physical surveys, and statistical analysis in the development of the model. Factors influencing the outcome of an urban heritage conservation project were listed from the literature and further refined through expert discussions to be utilised for the stakeholder survey. A questionnaire survey is administered within a heritage-sensitive urban area to identify the present state of heritage buildings and the living conditions of the stakeholders pertaining to the six aspects that determine the outcome of an urban heritage conservation project. The overall satisfaction of the stakeholder group was modelled using ordinal logistic regression against the various factors to arrive at factors that positively and negatively influenced them. \n\nThe model assessed that the satisfaction of the stakeholders who were a part of the historic site was highly influenced by their economic needs and the project's economic sustainability over other factors in the model. Urban economy consolidation, a known mechanism of improving an area's economic sustainability negatively affected the stakeholders' satisfaction. The results indicate that the factors under the social aspect were not significant determinants for the stakeholders of this urban heritage conservation project. \n\nThe methodology developed in this study can aid researchers and planners in identifying factors determining the outcome of an urban heritage conservation project while planning for development within a heritage-sensitive urban area."

Understanding how, when, and why/why not individuals utilise dental healthcare resources is essential for planning health services and developing policies as it reflects the population's oral health needs, helps allocate resources efficiently, and formulate policies that are tailored to address their needs.\n\nObjectives: To assess the utilisation of dental health services and its associated factors along with barriers and facilitators among adults residing in Ernakulam district, Kerala, using the Anderson healthcare model for healthcare utilisation.\n\nMethods: A mixed-method study was conducted among adults aged 18 years and above in urban and rural wards of Ernakulam district using the cluster sampling method. Univariate and multivariate analysis were used for the quantitative part, and thematic analysis was used for the qualitative aspect. The total sample size was 544.\n\nResults: Dental healthcare utilisation was 15.4 ± 2.9 % among the study participants. Age and education were associated with dental healthcare utilisation. The level of education, pain, and self-consciousness of oral diseases were independent predictors. Barriers identified were negative attitudes, financial restraints, and difficulty in access, while facilitators were trust in service providers, availability of services, and a positive attitude.\n\nConclusion: Utilisation was poor despite the perceived need for oral health care. This was affected by several personal and system-level facilitators and barriers."

Oral frailty, on the other hand, refers to a decline in oral function in conjunction with reductions in cognitive and physical functioning. Poor oral health, encompassing factors such as functional, physiological, psychosocial, and therapeutic aspects, can lead to physical frailty.\n\nObjectives: Assess the prevalence of physical and oral frailty in geriatric patients attending health centres in Kerala, India.\n\nMethodology: Design - Cross-sectional study. Setting - \nAmrita Institute of Medical Sciences (Kochi), Amrita Kripa Charitable Hospital (Wayanad) and Amrita Urban Health Centre in (Kaloor).\n\nParticipants: 250 geriatric participants above 60 years.\n\nMeasurements: The participants' physical frailty was evaluated using Fried's Frailty Phenotype, the Reported Edmonton Frail Scale, and sarcopenia screening. The assessment of oral frailty was based on several factors such as current dental status, chewing ability, tongue pressure, the Repetitive Saliva-Swallowing Test, Oral Diadokinetic rates, Xerostomia, and the Oral and Maxillofacial Index. The evaluation was using a questionnaire and clinical examination. Bivariate analysis was performed for additional variables, and multivariate analysis was utilised to examine the relationship between oral and physical frailty.\n\nResults: 56 % of study participants were males, and the mean age was 68 ± 6.02 years. 34.4 % were physically frail, and the remaining were pre-frail using Fried Frailty Phenotype. 67 % showed oral frailty using the Oral and Maxillofacial Frailty Index (OMFI). Using six domains of the oral frailty status (Tanaka) showed that 74 % of individuals had an increased risk of new onset of physical frailty. In the adjusted model, individuals with mild oral frailty had lesser chances of being frail (OR = 0.509, 95 % CI = 0.274–1.946, p-value = 0.033).\n\nConclusion: The prevalence of physical frailty was 34.4 %, and oral frailty status was 74 %. The findings implied a need to include oral frailty assessments in the comprehensive general health screening for geriatric patients."

This study aimed to explore the prevalence, awareness, treatment and control of hypertension and the associated factors among the adult tribal population in Kerala, India.\n\nMethods: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 206 adult tribal population in Thrissur district in Kerala. World Health Organization STEPS questionnaire for non-communicable disease risk factor surveillance was used. We measured blood pressure, weight and height using standard protocols. Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP)≥140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP)≥90 mmHg or on medication for high blood pressure. Multivariate logistic regression was done to find out the associated factors with hypertension.\n\nResults: The mean age of the participants was 44.7 years (SD ± 13.9; men:30%). Around 24% of the participants did not receive any formal education. Current tobacco prevalence was 28% and alcohol consumption was 19%. Nearly 63% were physically active. Prevalence of overweight was 33%. Hypertension prevalence was 48%. Among the hypertensive participants, 59% were aware of their condition, of which 74% were under treatment, and 7.8% achieved adequate control. In the age-sex adjusted multivariate analysis, being diabetic was the highest significant factor associated with the prevalence of hypertension (OR:9.58, CI: 1.87–49.07), followed by being overweight (OR:5.48, CI: 2.49–12.03).\n\nConclusion: This study indicates a high prevalence of hypertension and overweight among the selected tribal population. Our research highlights the importance of regular monitoring and consistent adherence to treatment for hypertension and other risk factors in this population."

    "abstract": "Over the years, numerous studies have identified factors influencing farmers’ adaptive behaviour in India, however, there is a dearth of studies with respect to determinants like institutions, incentives, and information. This study, therefore, aims to fill this gap by assessing role of these factors in driving climate-smart agriculture practices. \n\nIn total, 1274 farmers were surveyed from the 11 disaster-prone districts of four coastal states, namely, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Maharashtra. \n\nFrom the survey, it is observed that farmers are adopting seven non-mutually exclusive options, and thus, a multivariate probit model is employed. Our findings are: (i) more than 90 percent of the farmers adopt at least one option, and the most preferred measures are shifting of the crops, disaster-resilient crops, water management, and soil management options; (ii) in line with previous studies, the major determinants under household characteristics are livelihood diversification, and assets and amenities; (iii) access to soil health card is observed as the crucial factor for uptake of various options; (iv) none of the variables under institutions and incentives, and information, except for access to agro-met advisory services, are viewed as a major cause for adoption of all climate-smart agriculture options, but the mixed causal association is noticed for some of the measures. \n\nConcerning policy implications, this study advocates diversification of income sources, scaling up programmes related to soil health card and agro-met advisory services, and restructuring existing institutions, developmental interventions, incentive mechanisms, and communication channels. It is essential since the support of policies and institutions are needed for the diffusion of agricultural innovations."

    "abstract": "India experienced its sixth Nipah virus (NiV) outbreak in September 2023 in the Kozhikode district of Kerala state. The NiV is primarily transmitted by spillover events from infected bats followed by human-to-human transmission. \n\nThe clinical specimens were screened using real-time RT-PCR, and positive specimens were further characterized using next-generation sequencing. We describe here an in-depth clinical presentation and management of NiV-confirmed cases and outbreak containment activities. \n\nThe current outbreak reported a total of six cases with two deaths, with a case fatality ratio of 33.33%. The cases had a mixed presentation of acute respiratory distress syndrome and encephalitis syndrome. Fever was a persistent presentation in all the cases. The Nipah viral RNA was detected in clinical specimens until the post-onset day of illness (POD) 14, with viral load in the range of 1.7–3.3 × 104 viral RNA copies/mL. The genomic analysis showed that the sequences from the current outbreak clustered into the Indian clade similar to the 2018 and 2019 outbreaks. \n\nThis study highlights the vigilance of the health system to detect and effectively manage the clustering of cases with clinical presentations similar to NiV, which led to early detection and containment activities."

We established an integrated decision-making VIKOR framework, and preferential modelling by incorporating techno-economic and environmental aspects to draw the optimal solutions. \n\nLeveraging 10 sustainability indicators, the boat seine emerged as the most sustainable gear, showcasing significant profitability (US$ 16,126/year−1 net profit) and remarkable energy efficiency, surpassing gillnetters, longliners, and shore seiners by 8.4, 4.9, and 3.0 times, respectively. The Fuel Use Intensity (FUI) and CO2 emissions analysis (F value = 58.37, P < 0.0001) emphasizes the ecological implications. \n\nThe developed VIKOR sustainability index, introduced in this study, effectively assesses gear efficiency and sustainability. Further, the study revealed that gear selectivity, technical specifications, and operational trajectories considerably influence the index dynamics. \n\nThis research aligns with the global commitment to the Voluntary Guidelines for Securing Sustainable Small-Scale Fisheries (SSF Guidelines) and contributes scientifically to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). \n\nBy bridging empirical rigour with international frameworks, the study could aid in sustainable fisheries management and environmental stewardship, deemed essential for the global pursuit of ecological, economic, and social sustainability in small-scale fisheries."

    "abstract": "This research investigates the living sustainability of the Kattunayakan tribe in the Wayanad district of Kerala, India, focusing on the factors influencing their agricultural, forest, and livestock practices in the context of changing social conditions.\n\nThe main objective of the study is to identify critical factors that affect the Kattunayakan community and improve the living sustainability by linking agriculture, forest, livestock, and social conditions.\n\nA total of 598 families were sampled in the 103 settlements spread across 14 panchayats and three municipalities in Wayanad district of Kerala. Population distribution and land use pattern were related, and cluster analysis was carried out to identify tribes having agricultural land and livestock. The analysis of 21 factors with significant correlations with Kattunayakan's living sustainability was carried out.\n\nThe Kattunayakans' average annual agricultural income is extremely low, standing at US$472.54 and the average annual income from livestock is US$3.22. The increased wildlife conflicts have hindered Kattunayakans' ability to engage in agriculture and livestock-rearing activities. The factors considered included: agricultural infrastructure with eight factors, coefficients ranging from 0.523 to 0.969; forest and wildlife six factors 0.647–0.811; livestock four factors 0.527–0.696; and social conditions three factors with rotated values 0.499–0.856. \n\nThe lack of land for agriculture, very low attainment in education, and wildlife conflict correlate highly with the community's lack of sustainability. Allocation of degraded land for the landless tribes as non-sellable land for the cultivation of crops, increasing the awareness among the tribe to cultivate crops which is not palatable for wild animals, providing training for the tribe on the value addition of forest produce, selling milk through cooperative societies, can improve income generation among the tribe, thereby improving their living sustainability.\n\nThis study unveils the intricate dynamics influencing the living sustainability of Kattunayakan communities in Wayanad, Kerala. Findings of the study provide actionable insights to improve agricultural practices, mitigate conflicts, and promote sustainable development in the Wayanad district."

    "abstract": "Turmeric cultivation primarily thrives in India, followed by Bangladesh, Cambodia, Thailand, China, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines. India leads globally in both area and production of turmeric. Despite this, there is a recognised gap in research regarding the impact of climate change on site suitability of turmeric. \n\nThe primary objective of the present study was to evaluate both the present and future suitability of turmeric cultivation within the humid tropical region of Kerala, India, by employing advanced geospatial techniques. The research utilised meteorological data from the Indian Meteorological Department for the period of 1986–2020 as historical data and projected future data from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). Four climatic scenarios of shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change AR6 model of MIROC6 for the year 2050 (SSP 1–2.6, SSP 2–4.5, SSP 3–7.0 and SSP 5–8.5) were used. \n\nThe results showed that suitable area for turmeric cultivation is declining in future scenario and this decline can be primarily attributed to fluctuations in temperature and an anticipated increase in rainfall in the year 2050. Notable changes in the spatial distribution of suitable areas over time were observed through the application of geographic information system (GIS) techniques. Importantly, as per the suitability criteria provided by ICAR-National Bureau of Soil Survey and Land Use Planning (ICAR-NBSS & LUP), all the districts in Kerala exhibited moderately suitable conditions for turmeric cultivation. \n\nWith the GIS tools, the study identified highly suitable, moderately suitable, marginally suitable and not suitable areas of turmeric cultivation in Kerala. Presently 28% of area falls under highly suitable, 41% of area falls under moderately suitable and 11% falls under not suitable for turmeric cultivation. However, considering the projected scenarios for 2050 under the SSP framework, there will be a significant decrease in highly suitable area by 19% under SSP 5–8.5. This reduction in area will have an impact on the productivity of the crop as a result of changes in temperature and rainfall patterns. \n\nThe outcome of the present research suggests that the state of Kerala needs to implement suitable climate change adaptation and management strategies for sustaining the turmeric cultivation. Additionally, the present study includes a discussion on potential management strategies to address the challenges posed by changing climatic conditions for optimising turmeric production in the region."

Their detection is challenging because of their lower stability in natural conditions and low concentrations. \n\nThis study reports the presence of steroid hormones in a major river system, the Periyar River, in Kerala (India). Water samples were collected from thirty different river locations in the case of SHs and five locations within these in the case of other CECs. These were subjected to LC-MS/MS and LC-Q-ToF/MS analyses. Five SHs, estriol, estrone, 17 β estradiol, progesterone, and hydroxy progesterone, were separated and targeted using MS techniques. \n\nThe studies of the water samples confirmed the presence of the first three estrogens in different sampling sites, with estrone present in all the sampling sites. The concentration of estrone was detected in the range from 2 to 15 ng/L. Estriol and estradiol concentrations ranged from 1.0 to 5 ng/L and 1–6 ng/L, respectively. \n\nThe hormones at some selected sites were continuously monitored for seven months. The chosen areas include the feed water sites for the drinking water treatment plants across the river. The monthly data revealed that estrone is the only SHs detected in all the samples in the selected months. The highest concentration of SH was found in August. Twelve CECs belonging to pharmaceuticals and personal care products were identified and quantified. In addition, 31 other CECs were also identified using non-target analysis. \n\nA detailed study of the hormone mapping reported here is the first from any South Indian River."

    "abstract": "Dietary exposure to mercury through rice consumption is an issue of solemn global concern. The favourable bio-geochemical environment of paddy fields often makes them potential mercury cycling hotspots. India is one of the largest producers and consumers of rice globally. To date, studies focusing on mercury bioaccumulation in rice during the different stages of its growth cycle have not been studied in Indian agro-ecosystems.This inturn resulted in a knowledge gap in the global mercury assessment. Being a party to the Minamata Convention, there is an urgent need to unravel the scenario of mercury contamination in rice, one of the staple food crops across the world. In the present study, total mercury (THg) in the rhizosphere soil as well as its accumulation in different tissues of the rice plant were examined by a field investigation in Kuttanad – a unique Ramsar site in Kerala, India. For the purpose of the study five permanent plots were selected and monitored for the entire rice-growing season (from the 30th to the 120th day). Direct Mercury Analyzer (DMA – 80, Milestone, USA) was used for analyzing THg in rhizosphere soil and plant tissues. Mercury concentration in soils varied from 0.037 mg/kg to 0.117 mg/kg with a mean concentration of 0.088 mg/kg. The THg accumulation pattern in plant tissues followed the order: root > leaf > grain > husk > stem. The mean THg concentration in rice grains was 0.22 mg/kg. The low values for bioaccumulation factor (0.616) and translocation factor (0.425) revealed that a major portion of mercury accumulated by the plant is stored in the roots."

    "abstract": "The state of Kerala, located in southwest peninsular India, has experienced a series of extremely heavy rainfall events in the past few years, resulting in severe flooding and landslides. Among these events, an extremely heavy rainfall episode (50 to 480 mm/day) occurred during 14–17 August 2018 had led to devastating floods along the southwest coast of India. \n\nIn this study, we have chosen this event as a case study to analyse the role of orography, using a high-resolution (1-km) cloud-resolving WRF model configuration. We conducted four numerical sensitivity experiments to examine the impact of different topographic configurations, ranging from no-mountain to plateau, moderate, and steep mountain terrains, on the simulation of the extreme rainfall event. \n\nThe results of the mountain sensitivity experiments indicate that as mountain height increases, simulated low-level wind decelerates quickly. This flow blocking is also manifested in parameters such as reduced upper-air wind intensity, increased dynamical convergence, and increase of vertical velocities at the Western Ghat (WG) mountain barriers, which lead to the variations in moist instability and cloud microphysical processes influencing the horizontal and vertical distribution of solid-phase hydrometeors. \n\nFurthermore, the results also show that a reduction in the orography of the WGs decreases the vertical extension of low-level jet winds to upper levels, weakens the tropical easterly flow, and decreases the wind shears between the lower and upper troposphere. \n\nIn addition, the results suggest that large-scale variations in mountain orography in numerical simulations can affect the simulated magnitude and direction of moisture transport, which may have played a role in determining the magnitude and distribution of simulated rainfall over Kerala."

    "abstract": "In India, tick-borne diseases are prevalent in many states due to the presence of tick vectors. However, information on disease-causing ticks from domestic animals and the associated risk factors for residents living in the disease-endemic area is lacking. Therefore, we conducted this study to identify ixodid ticks in goats and human risk factors in three villages of the Wayanad District of Kerala. \n\nWe examined 202 goats and collected 741 ticks, of which 69.8% were ticks belonging to the genus <i>Haemaphysalis</i>. The maximum number of ticks was collected from Thirunelli (81.3%), followed by Noolpuzha (76.27%) and Pulpally (45.6%). Overall, <i>H. bispinosa</i> Neumann, 1897 (54.6%), was the most common species, followed by <i>H. turturis</i> Nuttall and Warburton, 1915 (38.0%), <i>H. spinigera</i> Neumann, 1897 (5.4%), and <i>H. intermedia</i> Warburton and Nuttall, 1909 (1.8%). We included 428 participants (men and women) in this study. The average age of the respondents was 43 years. \n\nWe found significant associations between accessing the forest for cattle grazing and other activities and tick-borne diseases (χ2 = 9.5, p = 0.002), between workers who were bitten by ticks and tick-borne diseases (χ2 = 3.8, p = 0.05), and between number of tick bites per day > 6 and tick-borne diseases (χ2 = 12.1, p = 0.001). The high frequency of <i>Haemaphysalis</i> spp. found in goats highlighted the risk of tick exposure and tick-borne diseases, such as Kyasanur forest disease in humans, and the need for the development and implementation of effective measures to control ticks."

    "abstract": "The diversity, composition, and abundance of soil fungi from three sacred groves in Kerala, namely Iringole kavu of Ernakulam District, Kollakal Thapovanam of Alappuzha District, and Poyilkavu of Kozhikode District were analysed using Metagenomics analysis and Illumina sequencing. A total of 30,584, 78,323, and 55,640 reads were obtained from these groves, respectively. \n\nAscomycota constitutes over 96% of the total fungi, making it the most abundant phylum, followed by Mortierellomycota, Basidiomycota, Chytridiomycota, and Rozellomycota. These phyla were subdivided into 20 classes, 40 orders, 83 families, 119 genera, and 135 species, while 1269 OTUs remained unidentified at the species level. Eurotiomycetes predominates the class, while the genus <i>Talaromyces</i> from the family Trichomaceae dominates the genera. <i>Neocarmospora falciformis</i>, <i>Trichoderma lixii</i>, and <i>Candida ethanolic</i> are the most abundant fungal species. \n\nDiversity analysis shows that Kollakal Thapovanam is rich in fungal species, while Poyilkavu is rich in biodiversity, with a high degree of dominance. Several species were found only in a particular grove and were absent in others and vice-versa, indicating high fungal specificity. Therefore, fungi have to be preserved in their original habitat. \n\nThe Principal Coordinate Analysis revealed that each grove is distinct highlighting the importance of preserving the unique diversity of each sacred grove. In conclusion, this research provides valuable information about the soil fungal genera in their natural habitat. It emphasises the need for more systematic research to understand the actual diversity and ecological role of fungi in sacred groves. \n\nThis study is the first of its kind to analyse and compare soil fungal diversity in sacred groves using the metagenomics approach."

The predictive model is trained and evaluated on a handcrafted grade prediction dataset, which contains the academic performance of the students during Plus 2 and from Semester 1 to Semester 4 of a group of Computer science and Engineering majors in Kerala. By processing historical academic records and contextual information, the GRU model learns to predict future performance accurately. To enhance the model's efficacy and interpretability, ANOVA is applied to optimize the feature selection process. This statistical technique identifies the most influential factors contributing to final grades, refining the model's predictive power while reducing dimensionality. \n\nThe experimental results showcase the model's effectiveness in predicting final semester grades, demonstrating superior accuracy and performance compared to grade prediction using CNN with Bayesian optimization and LSTM with L1-Norm optimization."

    "abstract": "Drought is a natural phenomenon which is considered as an indicator of changing climatic conditions. The growth of crops is significantly affected by the lack of soil moisture caused by insufficient rainfall over a specific period. \n\nThis study examines the occurrence of drought over seven districts in Kerala, India, by utilising drought indices, namely the standardised precipitation index (SPI) and the agricultural standardised precipitation index (aSPI). The measured data pertaining to rainfall and computed data of crop yield of the seven districts have been gathered to analyse the teleconnections of crop yield. Modified standardised yield residual series (M-SYRS) of different crops are prepared by the proposed approach of empirical mode decomposition-based detrending. \n\nThe correlation between aSPI and M-SYRS exhibits a higher magnitude compared to the correlation that SPI and M-SYRS, confirming the significance of aSPI in the analysis of agricultural yield. The wavelet coherence analysis yields the values of percentage of significant coherence (PoSC) and average wavelet coherence (AWC) for the time scales of 3, 6, and 12 months, with respect to the variables aSPI and crop yield. The crop with the greatest AWC value of 0.71 and PoSC value of 62 is banana, which holds a dominant position in the agricultural landscape of Kottayam District. It is further noted that the short to medium seasonal droughts have profound impact on the agricultural yield of the different districts."

    "abstract": "This scientific article presents a comprehensive exploration of the intriguing ecological phenomenon known as ‘red rain’, observed in the coastal town located at latitude N 11°.61108 and longitude E 75°.57383 in Kerala, India. The study aims to elucidate the origins, characteristics, and potential environmental implications associated with this phenomenon. \n\nThrough a meticulous descriptive analysis, incorporating microscopic evaluation, DNA-sequencing, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC–MS) analysis, and phylogenetic analysis, we deciphered the underlying factors responsible for the distinct red coloration observed in the rain. \n\nOur research findings highlight the presence of specific organic compounds, namely psi-psi Carotene 3,4 didehydro-1,2,7′8'-tetrahydro-1-methoxy-2-oxo and psi-psi and- Carotene 3,3',4,4'-tetradehydro1′2' dihydro 1-hydroxy-1'-methoxy in the algae, Trentepohlia abietina, as the primary contributors to the red color observed in the red rain. \n\nThe research findings contribute to a deeper understanding of this distinctive occurrence and its implications for the local ecosystem in Kerala."

    "abstract": "Muslim communities of Malabar, popularly known as Mappilas, are one of the largest Islamic communities in South Asia. The community has long had a reputation for being violent and ignorant, and such a reputation, gained over several centuries, has been a result of resistance against European colonial regimes. Both colonial and post-colonial scholarship stereotyped them as agents of fanaticism and considered their literary expressions in the Arabic-Malayalam (Malayalam as written in Arabic script) hagiographies with overtly religious skepticism, as having no value to any scientific history. \n\nThis chapter seeks to establish a fresh set of paradigms by analysing their hagiography as a ‘genuine’ repository of memories of ‘friends of God’, guiding Mappilas and their devotions, thus articulating their religious and social past. \n\nThe chapter demonstrates how textual commemoration of charismatic saints unveiled an idiosyncratic historical sensibility that has been imagined and devised by the Mappilas in hagiographies, conceding that their ‘history’ is being written in various literary styles, quite distinct from the standard European notion of history-writing. \n\nBy analysing the process of the canonisation of Muslim ‘holy men and women’, in <i>mālappāṭṭŭ</i> (‘garland songs’), this study probes how hagiographies textualised and constructed saintly charisma. This study also investigates how these hagiographies presented the constitutive memories of saints made and remade to serve changing societal interests and needs of the ordinary Muslims in 19th-century Malabar. \n\nSuch textualised saints address hagiographies as strong memories or communal pasts of Mappilas, countering the colonial manipulations of the Mappila community as ‘ignorant fanatics’, hence discovering their marginalised self-expression."

    "abstract": "How do we understand differences and disputes among various branches of Islam? This book places intimacies, rather than radical incompatibilities, at the centre of its in-depth ethnographic account of mass-publicised theological polemics among Sunni Muslims in the south Indian state of Kerala.\n\nWhat unites Muslims of different Sunni groups also divides them and incites polemics—Islam as a shared system of knowledge and practices, bonds of kinship and other social relations, and the common condition of being a beleaguered religious minority in a Hindu majoritarian democracy.\n\nDiverging from works that have focused on how Islamic practices like ritual prayers facilitate the fashioning of theologically grounded pious selves, the book argues that intra-Muslim polemics marginalise theology and have little to do with cultivating piety. Instead, polemics constitute inter- and intra-religious socialities, enable Muslims to articulate their connections to India and other imaginaries, and produce Islam as a public religion in a secular nation-state."

Furthermore, despite ritual’s close relationship with tradition, ritual is amenable to continuous reinvention due to the inherent adaptability of tradition."

    "abstract": "The paper undertakes the eco-spatial re-reading of two Malayalam movies, <i>Kumbalangi Nights</i> (2019) and <i>Malik</i> (2021), using the framework of solastalgia. Solastalgia is an environmental philosophy developed by Glenn Albrecht that refers to the feeling of abandonment and isolation in relation to a drastically transformed spatial circumstance. It is the paradoxical sense of homelessness while still being home. \n\nThe paper argues that solastalgia is a heuristic framework to analyse unjust geographies and reimagine them as forums for creative resilience, collective strength, and political action. The movies explore the ramifications of lived space on the life of people living in it and its coalescing with other social, political, and economic categories of injustice. \n\n<i>Kumbalangi</i> tells the story of four brothers living on a stranded island in the neighbourhood of a city and how they creatively resist the solastalgic distress caused by the neoliberal social order. <i>Malik<i>, set in a densely populated coastal village, delineates how solastalgia is instrumental in excessive criminalisation and breakage of the social fabric. \n\nThe discussion of the movies seeks to show how cultural narratives such as films can be seen as important tools to represent unjust geographies, and resist them through rebellious re-imagination."

The preference for representations of big cities such as Mumbai in fiction means that non-metropolitan (‘provincial’) spaces in India face neglect, literary and otherwise. \n\nThis article argues for provincialising Indian fiction by exploring non-metropolitan locations as imagined in works of fiction to unpack alternative spatialities. The example offered is Salman Rushdie’s <i>The Moor’s Last Sigh</i>. \n\nIn most readings of the novel, Bombay (along with Moorish Spain) is highlighted as a metropolitan model for India. Cochin does not figure in these readings, passed over as if just a random background or setting for the characters to be launched into Mumbai. \n\nThis article addresses Cochin’s marginalisation through investigating the way the island city offers a provincial, alternative, non-metropolitan theorization of spatialities in Indian fiction. The larger objective is to make space for similarly marginalised non-European locales in the discourse of cosmopolitanism."

The public welfare demands appropriate targeted healthcare subsidies for non-communicable diseases. \n\nIn this paper, we investigate whether out-of-pocket expenditure toward mitigating non-communicable diseases for the poorer section of the population is catastrophic by nature. In a representative futuristic scenario for an emerging economy, we have collected the cancer patients’ expenditure data from the patients and hospital management in a not-for-profit cancer hospital located in the state of Kerala. \n\nWe have analysed the variation of expenditure categorised as government subsidy toward treatment, private expenditure toward medical goods and services, and private expenditure toward non-medical goods and services against different socio-economic variables. \n\nThe analysis of catastrophic health expenditure data reveals that relatively lower income lower-income households face more risk of catastrophic health expenditure and are in greater need of government subsidy."

Among them, 50 were purposively selected for qualitative assessment. \n\nThe quantitative assessment examined self-esteem, personality dimensions, and various risk factors associated with relapse. On the other hand, the qualitative assessment explored individual, psychological, familial, societal, and economic challenges. \n\nAmong the beneficiaries, 271 were current and 166 ex-beneficiaries, and among the latter, 73 had addiction relapse. Relapsed patients were younger, had relatively stable jobs, used multiple substances more frequently, and had a family history of addiction. Additionally, individual risk factors of impulsivity and environmental risk factors of association with deviant peers were prevalent. \n\nQualitative analysis identified risk and protective factors under three major domains – individual, environmental and familial. In relapsed patients, the individual and psychological vulnerabilities were activated by social and familial triggers. Though the family was protective, the patient’s expectations from the family were dissimilar and vague, which would be clarified during the treatment process. Therefore, the research suggests developing a patient-centric and process-driven personal care plan to prevent the risk of addiction relapse."

Their counterhegemonic writings are often ignored or labeled ‘uncouth’ for the literary public. \n\nThrough a reading of <i>Pulayathara</i> (1962), we examine the following questions – Do errors in the English translations of Dalit literature always result in what Venuti calls, the ‘ethnocentric violence’ of a culture? How does the lack of cohesive readership, given the fact that the target audience can be both foreigners and a wide cross-section of heterogeneous Indians, complicate the translator’s job? \n\nWe argue that translations of Dalit literature from Malayalam to English contest caste-determined regimes of writing and reading, making the project a subversive force that challenges established power structures."

    "abstract": "Understanding the association of climatic oscillations (COs) and meteorological parameters (MPs) with rainfall is of considerable significance in the management of water resources. This study used bivariate wavelet coherence (BWC), partial wavelet coherence (PWC) and multiple wavelet coherence (MWC) formulations for investigating the multiscale coherence of monthly mean rainfall of Calicut, Kerala, India with diverse sets of COs and local MPs. Firstly, the multiscale association between rainfall of 1970 and 2019 with four COs, viz., El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) are investigated using different WC formulations. The BWC and PWC analyses detected PDO and NAO as the significant COs influencing rainfall of Calicut, strongly modulated by ENSO and IOD. MWC analysis with 11 combinations of COs revealed the highest coherence for ENSO–IOD and ENSO–PDO–NAO, indicating an equally strong influence of different COs upon the rainfall of Calicut. Further, the teleconnections of rainfall with local MPs, viz., maximum temperature (Tmax), minimum temperature (Tmin), wind speed (U) and evaporation (E) over Calicut are also analyzed. The BWC analysis detected annual periodicity in all the time series, with an additional band at the scale of six months in Tmin series. The coherence strength quantified in terms of average wavelet coherence (AWC) and percentage of significant coherence (PSC) showed that evaporation was the most significant MP (AWC of 0.66 and PSC of 54%) modulated strongly by wind speed. The MWC analysis of rainfall with MPs displayed the highest coherence for Tmin–E and U–Tmin–E combinations in the rainfall of Calicut."

    "abstract": "Seventh pandemic <i>Vibrio choleare</i> O1 El Tor strain is responsible for the on-going pandemic outbreak of cholera globally. This strain evolved from non-pathogenic <i>V. cholerae</i> by acquiring seventh pandemic gene (VC 2346), pandemic Islands (VSP1 and VSP2), pathogenicity islands (VP1 and VP2) and CTX prophage region. The cholera toxin production is mainly attributed to the presence of <i>ctx</i> gene in these strains. However, several variants of this strain emerged as hybrid strains or atypical strains. \n\nThe present study aimed to assess the aquatic environment of Cochin, India, over a period of 5 years for the emergence of multidrug resistant <i>V. cholerae</i> and its similarity with seventh pandemic strain. The continuous surveillance and monitoring resulted in the isolation of <i>ctx</i> negative, O1 positive <i>V. cholerae isolate</i> (VC6) from coastal water, Cochin, Kerala. The isolate possessed the biotype specific O1 El Tor <i>tcpA</i> gene and lacked other biotype specific <i>ctx, zot, ace</i> and <i>rst</i> genes. \n\nWhole genome analysis revealed the isolate belongs to pandemic sequence type (ST) 69 with the possession of pandemic VC2346 gene, pathogenic island VPI1, VPI2, and pandemic island VSP1 and VSP2. The isolate possessed several insertion sequences and the SXT/R391 family related Integrative Conjugative Elements (ICEs). In addition to this, the isolate genome carried virulence genes such as <i>VgrG, mshA, ompT, toxR, ompU, rtxA, als, VasX, makA,</i> and <i>hlyA</i> and antimicrobial resistance genes such as <i>gyrA, dfrA1, strB, parE, sul2, parC, strA, VC1786ICE9-floR,</i> and <i>catB9</i>. \n\nMoreover, the phylogenetic analysis suggests that the isolate genome is more closely related to seventh pandemic <i>V. cholerae</i> O1 N16961 strain. This study reports the first incidence of environmental <i>ctx</i> negative seventh pandemic <i>V. choleare</i> O1 El Tor isolate, globally and its presence in the aquatic system likely to induce toxicity in terms of public health point of view. \n\nThe presence of this isolate in the aquatic environment warns the strict implementation of the epidemiological surveillance on the occurrence of emerging strains and the execution of flagship programme for the judicious use of antibiotics in the aquatic ecosystem."

This article delves into the epidemiological details of these cases, shedding light on the two fatalities that occurred in September 2023 and August 2023 as well as the suspected cases that have undergone testing. Nipah virus, known for its severe neurological and respiratory disease manifestations, remains a formidable health threat due to the lack of specific treatments or vaccines. The government’s response to these recent cases, including mass testing and quarantine measures, is discussed, drawing lessons from past outbreaks in the region. Kerala has experienced multiple Nipah virus outbreaks since 2018, prompting a closer examination of environmental factors, such as deforestation and urbanization, which increase the risk of zoonotic transmission. This article underscores the global implications of Nipah virus resurgence in Kerala and emphasizes the importance of preparedness and vigilance in the face of emerging infectious diseases. The lessons learned from Kerala’s experience with Nipah virus outbreaks provide valuable insights for public health professionals and policymakers worldwide."

Despite the absence of statistically significant trends in the monthly, seasonal and annual rainfall, based on the Mann-Kendall trend analysis, an increase in the yield of many crops (e.g., winter paddy, banana) is evident, which emphasises the critical role of irrigation in driving the crop productivity. As an adaptation strategy to changing rainfall patterns, irrigation would meet the additional crop water requirement for sustainable agricultural production under the varying rainfall distributions. However, the increase in the area under irrigation in recent years has had significant implications for both surface water and groundwater resources. The conclusive findings suggest that the region requires climate-resilient agriculture, focusing on optimising irrigation and developing sustainable agriculture and water conservation strategies."

    "abstract": "Anthrophony is an important determinant of habitat quality in the Anthropocene. Acoustic adaptation of birds at lower levels of anthrophony is known. However, threshold anthrophony, beyond which biophony starts decreasing, is less explored. Here, we present empirical results of the relationship between anthrophony and biophony in four terrestrial soundscapes. The constancy of the predicted threshold vector normalised anthropogenic power spectral density (~ 0.40 Watts/Hz) at all the study sites is intriguing. \n\nWe propose the threshold value of anthropogenic power spectral density as an indicator of the avian acoustic tolerance level in the study sites. The findings pave the way to determine permissible sound levels within protected landscapes and directly contribute to conservation planning."

    "abstract": "Floods are the most devastating global hazard which affect the environment and economy of several regions in the world. Flood management requires the identification of areas susceptible to flooding and measuring the impact of flood conditioning parameters. This study examines the application of bivariate relative frequency ratio (RFR) and multivariate logistic regression (L.R.) models to identify flood-susceptible regions in three districts of northern Kerala, India. A comprehensive flood susceptibility study utilizing high-resolution terrain information and past flood inventory is conducted in the study area. The current study generated the flood inventory of August 2018 during the Kerala floods using Sentinel-imagery of 10 m resolution. Thirteen flood conditioning parameters related to the terrain, land usage, climate and vegetation are used as independent variables in the statistical modeling. The terrain-related parameters such as elevation, slope, curvature, flow accumulation, topographic wetness index (TWI), and stream power index (SPI) are derived from CartoDEM of 10 m resolution. The other independent variables used are rainfall, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), waterbody distance, drainage density, soil type, and geology. In GIS, the dependent and independent variables are spatially combined, and SPSS and R are used for statistical modeling and validation. The final flood susceptibility map is divided into the risk categories of very low, low, medium, high, and very high. Both RFR and L.R. model results were found reliable, and the low-lying coastal wetlands are highly susceptible to flooding in the study area. The area under curve values show that the L.R. model performs better with 92.7% accuracy than the RFR model with 85.6% accuracy. The generated flood susceptibility map can be a valuable tool for sustainable planning and development in the target region."

    "abstract": "Potholes are microhabitats in riverine ecosystems that substantially contribute to the unique regional faunal diversity and community composition. Investigations on the ecological status of potholes in riverine habitats are very scanty. The present work is of utmost importance, particularly as a pioneering study to evaluate the health status of riverine potholes using aquatic insects as potential biological indicators. Samples of water and aquatic insects were collected and analyzed during the pre-monsoon season from February 2022 to May 2022 in the potholes at Athirappilly and the Ezhattumugham regions of the Chalakudy river basin. The present study identified 208 individuals represented by 15 families in the potholes at Athirappilly, whereas 94 individuals belong to 10 families at Ezhattumugham. The computation of water quality parameters and benthic metrics revealed a significant variation between the stations. Spearman correlation analysis revealed that the water temperature, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen concentration, and biochemical oxygen demand were influencing the distribution of aquatic insects in the potholes. Families such as Perlidae, Ephemeridae, Baetidae, Stenopsychidae, and Hydropsychidae (sensitive families) reported from the well-oxygenated potholes at Athirappilly, where the water temperature and biochemical oxygen demand were minimum. The significantly high percentage composition of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera taxa and a low family biotic index value indicate good health condition of the potholes at Athirappilly. In contrast, the low percentage composition of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera taxa and high family biotic index values, with the abundance of tolerant families (Micronectidae, Caenidae, and Chironomidae), reflect the impact of organic pollution at Ezhattumugham."

    "abstract": "The primary objective of the current study is to shed light on specific instances of failures or inadequate performance of geosynthetic-reinforced MSE walls situated in the state of Kerala, India. The research also puts forth potential remedial actions and precautions. \n\nIt is noteworthy that a majority of these failures of geosynthetic-reinforced MSE walls in Kerala occurred either during or following the monsoon season. \n\nThe primary factors contributing to these failures were identified as the utilisation of locally available marginal lateritic soils in the backfill, insufficient management of external and internal drainage systems, suboptimal filter and drain designs, inadequate compaction of foundation soil, and the lack of necessary ground improvement measures prior to commencing MSE wall construction. The corrective measures proposed include structural repairs involving compaction grouting and soil nailing, reconstruction, and the implementation of stone columns, among others. \n\nTo mitigate the ingress of rainwater into low-permeability backfill material, preventive measures are suggested for both during and after construction. Rainfall infiltration has been linked to undesirable deformations and bulging in MSE walls. During construction, the backfill can be covered at the end of each workday, and post-construction, a geomembrane layer can be employed to seal the surface. Additionally, a reduction in interface shear strength resulting from the loss of suction due to rain-induced wetting should be considered when utilising marginal lateritic soil as the backfill for MSE walls. \n\nFurthermore, the study found that stone columns effectively enhance the bearing capacity and drainage of compressible clay foundations beneath MSE walls. The reconstruction of a collapsed MSE wall underscores the significance of thorough site investigation and the adoption of appropriate ground improvement measures when necessary."

    "abstract": "Land gets contaminated due to different human activities like illegal industrial discharges, mining activities, and spillage of chemicals. The pollutants released through these activities can have prolonged effects on the environment and human health. Therefore, there is a need for immediate remediation of the contaminated site. \n\nDifferent remediation technologies are available for remediating a land contaminated with a particular contaminant. Selection of the most appropriate remediation technology among all those available would help in quick and efficient remediation of the land. There are multiple factors deciding the appropriateness of a technology for a given case. \n\n‘Remediability’ is a term introduced in the scientific literature recently to describe the ease with which a contaminated land can be remediated and ‘Remediability Score (RS)’ quantifies remediability in a 0–100 scale. The higher the value of RS, the greater is the difficulty for remediation. The factors influencing remediability were presented before a group of experts in a Delphi process for assigning comparative importance. From the importance score obtained in a Saaty scale of 1 to 9, the weights of factors were calculated using Fuzzy AHP. The overall RS was calculated by taking the weighted impact of the factors after their magnitudes were normalized. RS for the various remediation technologies feasible for a contaminated site, Kuzhikandam, near Kochi, Kerala was calculated. \n\nThe site was revealed to be contaminated with heavy metals and organic compounds in a field investigation. The most suitable technology for remediating the selected site was found to be vitrification with an RS of 22. The next best technology, stabilisation/solidification, had an RS of 25. The study showed that RS can be a reliable matric for selecting the most suitable remediation technology for a contaminated site."

    "abstract": "The spatial and temporal dynamics of daily ultraviolet index (UVI) for a period of 18 years (2004–2022) over the Indian state of Kerala were statistically characterised in the study. The UVI measurements used for the study were derived from the ultraviolet-B (UVB) irradiance measured by the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) of the AURA satellite and classified into different severity levels for analysis. Basic statistics of daily, monthly and seasonal UVI as well as Mann-Kendall (MK) statistical trend characteristics and the rate of change of daily UVI using Theil-Sen’s slope test were also evaluated. A higher variability of UVI characteristics was observed in the Kerala region, and more than 79% of the measurements fell into the categories of very high and extreme UVI values, which suggests the need of implementation of appropriate measures to reduce health risks. Although the UVI measured during the study period shows a slight decrease, most of the data show a seasonal variation with undulating low and peak values. Higher UVI are observed during the months of March, April and September. The region also has higher UVI during the southwest monsoon (SWM) and summer seasons. Although Kerala region as a single whole unit, UVI show a non-significant decreasing trend (-0.83), the MK test revealed the increasing and decreasing trends of UVI ranging from -1.96 to 0.41 facilitated the delineation of areas (domains) where UVI are increasing or decreasing. The domain of UVI increase occupies the central and southern (S) parts, and the domains of decrease cover the northern (N) and S parts of the Kerala region. The rate of change of daily UVI in domain of increase and decrease shows an average rate of 0.34 × 10−5 day−1 and −2 × 10−5 day−1, respectively. The parameters (rainfall, air temperature, cloud optical depth (COD) and solar zenith angle (SZA)) that affect the strength of UV rays reaching the surface indicate that a cloud-free atmosphere or low thickness clouds prevails in the Kerala region. Overall, the study results indicate the need for regular monitoring of UVI in the study area and also suggest appropriate campaigns to disseminate information and precautions for prolonged UVI exposure to reduce the adverse health effects, since the study area has a high population density."

    "abstract": "This article is an attempt to explore a couple of apparent paradoxes in connection with Sreenarayana Guru and his life and works. <i>Karuna</i> or compassion encapsulates the essence of Guru’s politics and life. One cannot teach others to be compassionate. Compassion erupts into existence when one acts compassionately. The chief interest in this exploration is to see how political action is possible without assuming a pre-formed political subject. It also tries to imagine the ways in which the politics of compassion might be reinvented in contemporary times without assuming the existence of Guru-like persons. Though Guru was instrumental in the making of Modern Kerala, his own self-understanding acknowledged no doer behind the deeds. Thus, the very modern habit of ascribing agency to Guru (when thinking, for instance, of renaissance or modernity) becomes problematic. By examining these paradoxes, I wish to further problematize Guru’s allegiance to Advaita. It is argued that his critique of caste was based less on philosophical doctrines than ontological alertness."

In contrast, for contemporary philosophy of alterity, being a self involves exposure to otherness rather than self-coinciding immediacy of identity. \n\nIn this regard, the advaitic tropes motivating the writings and reformist activities of the 20th-century poet-reformer Narayana Guru can be interpreted in relation to the philosophy of the Other as a form of ‘self-othering’ for two reasons. First, the Self that he is concerned with is other than the Other, or non-dual awareness of moral-ontological connectedness of all beings. Second, in matters of social action, he manifests a distinctive manner of de-emphasising the self, welcoming and identifying with the Other, and correcting oppressive social practices through peaceful and dialogical encounters without resorting to hostile confrontation."

Our results indicate those fleeing from environmental stress often move to nearby areas, sometimes shifting multiple times before settling down permanently. We also found that climate conditions of the potential destination, its geographic and social proximity to area or origin, and affordability are the most influential factors in destination selection. The relative importance of these factors varied significantly according to respondents’ occupation and migration status."

    "abstract": "This paper examines the impact of international migration on inter-generational educational mobility (IGEM) among left-behind children in migrant-sending households in the origin. IGEM, measured as the difference in completed education between a parent and child, is a measure of mobility (or persistence) of educational attainments between generations within a household. If migration leads to a higher IGEM, it can be considered as a mechanism that creates a catching up effect in the society, as it enables attainability of aspirations irrespective of the initial distribution of endowments. \n\nThe study uses data on 15,000 households from the Kerala Migration Survey 2018 and compares the IGEM of households with an international migration experience to those without it and finds the migration of a household member significantly and positively affects intergenerational educational mobility of children in the household. \n\nDisaggregating the sample by social and economic groups reveals that this impact is significantly higher in households from the middle and lower-middle income and social groups. However, children from the lowest income quintile and social strata, especially from communities that are educationally most backward, did not register any significant improvement in IGEM due to migration. This indicates that migration acts as a catching up mechanism for the middle strata of the society while it seems to leave the most disadvantaged sections, relatively even more disadvantaged."

Internationally, there is clear evidence for the deleterious effects of residential schools on the mental health and social and community outcomes of Indigenous children, however little is known about the Indian Indigenous experience. \n\nThis study examined the impact of residential schooling on Indigenous children's wellbeing and that of their communities, using data from an ethnographic research project in Attapadi, Kerala, including interviews, focus group discussions and participant observation with Indigenous communities. \n\nKey outcomes from residential schooling reported by the participants include the fear of losing Indigenous identity, shame of being Indigenous, change in the attitude of young people when they returned from schools, and feelings of confusion and stress that young Indigenous participants felt trying to fit into their communities on their return. \n\nFindings suggest that these Indigenous youth felt disconnected from several factors that are known to promote resilience for Indigenous communities including a strong cultural identity, connection to the land and ancestors, thereby making them more vulnerable to poor mental health and negative impacts on their overall wellbeing. \n\nAddressing these concerns requires a detailed understanding of the specific factors influencing outcomes for Indigenous youth within the Indian residential schooling system, and designing and implementing data-informed conceptual, structural and policy change including the provision of culturally safe mental health services."

    "abstract": "This article discusses women’s role in Kerala’s small-scale marine fishing industry and changes that took place during COVID-19. \n\nPandemic conditions enabled and accelerated the restructuring of Kerala’s fishing industry practices, leaving marginal groups even more marginal. Small-scale producers and sellers were edged out by larger players in a new wholesale market. \n\nMeanwhile, female vendors who utilised public transport and face-to-face sales methods found themselves locked out from new retail methods introduced during the pandemic, which made use of smartphone apps, online platforms, and private light vehicles. Underemployed workers with access to digital technology and mobility moved in to fill the lockdown retail gap. The Gulf states’ continuing squeeze on jobs and resultant migration slow-down contributed to these trends. \n\nFemale fish-vending activity has also been affected by Kerala’s acceleration of bourgeois respectability norms. The state government’s modernisation and centralisation policies also led to the shrinking of women’s spaces in fish auction markets. Recent inequalities in digital and mobility access sit on top of longstanding entrenched class and status inequities and conservative gender norms, while the enduring chronic ‘wicked problem’ of Kerala’s unemployment levels demands urgent attention."

    "abstract": "The economic and social consequences of reliance on informal finance are enormous in the case of socially and economically disadvantaged people like the tribal communities. These communities have become more financially vulnerable due to the severe barriers in accessing institutionalised formal finance. \n\nDrawing on data collected from 246 randomly chosen households from four tribal communities (Kurichya, Kuruma, Adiya and Paniya) in the Wayanad District of Kerala, and using mixed-method approach, the study seeks to examine the repercussions of reliance on informal source of finance by the tribal communities. \n\nThe study reveals that the agents of informal financiers also resort to social demoralising and mental harassment towards the tribal households. The study shows that tribal households may not be aware of compounding effect of interest rates when they avail credit from any source of finance, especially informal finance. This in turn increases the indebtedness among the tribal communities. All these call for the need of tailoring institutional (formal) credit solutions suitable to the credit needs and socio-economic conditions of the weaker segments of the society like the tribal communities. The study suggests adopting supply-side cum demand-side strategies."

These COPCORD studies conducted in rural Bhigwan and urban Pune in Maharashtra, rural Calicut and rural Trivandrum in Kerala and rural and urban Lucknow in Uttar Pradesh, along with data from the Global Burden of Diseases study have helped to understand the burden of rheumatic diseases in the community. \n\nBased on these studies, RMSK diseases, which are amongst the top 25 causes of disability in the Indian population, are prevalent in nearly 25%–30% of the Indian population. The common rheumatic diseases in the community are soft tissue rheumatism, neck and back pain, fibromyalgia and unspecified pains and osteoarthritis (most commonly affecting the knee). These diseases most commonly affect young persons between the third to the fifth decade of life, more often affect females, are prevalent in both rural and urban populations, and account for considerable disability in up to one-fifth of individuals leading to loss of livelihood and dependence on others for self-care. \n\nCommunity-based national healthcare programs to manage RMSK diseases at the community level are urgently needed. There also remains an unmet need to train more doctors to diagnose and manage rheumatic diseases at the primary, secondary and tertiary levels of care."

This descriptive phenomenological study examines mothers’ perspectives on SRHR of adolescents with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). \n\nThe study involved 21 participants selected through purposive sampling, and data saturation criteria were applied. Data was gathered through face-to-face, semi-structured, in-depth interviews. The participants were from backgrounds marked by poor socio-economic conditions that may have influenced their experiences and perceptions. \n\nThe study identifies key themes, including ‘neglect and denial of sexual and reproductive health education (SRHE)’, ‘fear of sexual abuse’, and ‘healthcare inequity’. It is essential to prioritise inclusive SRHE and ensure accessible healthcare services. \n\nThe paper discussed social work implications also. In this scenario, it is crucial to enable parents and educators with the knowledge for informed discussions—needed innovative interventions aimed at promoting the SRHR of adolescents with IDD."

Two experienced LMHWs worked as supervisors for a total of 12 LMHWs over the course of a year. These participants were subsequently interviewed to analyse their experiences in order to evaluate the potential of peer supervision and distil relevant information to improve future training of LMHWs. The findings include improved performance and emotional support for the participants."

The concentrations of metals and their pollution levels were studied for four tropical tourist beaches in Kerala state, Southern India. \n\nBulk geochemical and mineralogical analyses of 16 sediment samples were performed to determine the environmental status and the environmental risk level using various geochemical indices. Based on the enrichment of TiO2 and SiO2 concentrations, the samples were grouped into ilmenite-rich samples (IRS) and quartz-rich samples (QRS) respectively and the geochemical signatures are significantly different. Mineralogically, the IRS group is dominated by ilmenite, quartz, sillimanite, zircon and rutile while the QRS group consists of quartz, spinel and calcite and garnets are common in both groups of sediments. \n\nDespite the variation in the trends of pollution indices, it has been found that Kovalam beach sediments are enriched with W, Th and U where, IRS with enrichment of W, U and Th while QRS only enriched with W and Th and not U. The mineralogical affinity of W with secondary tungsten-bearing minerals has been documented by the XRD analysis and these metals are mainly controlled by the geogenic sourced minerals. However, in terms of ecological risk, Pb, As and Cu have a considerable to moderate risk in both groups of sediments. Overall, both group of sediments shows a moderate risk. Based on the biological effect assessment the elements of concern are Pb and Zn in IRS and possible effect by the Cr, Cu and As in IRS and only by Cu in QRS. \n\nThough the prevalence of geogenic and anthropogenic processes and influences of metal enrichments are documented by the study, their relative influences, mobility and bioavailability need to be systematically studied."

The manner in which one person's intervention in one community is receiving attention from individuals and groups beyond the shores of Kerala and outside the original community within which he had his receptivity is shown as providing the transformative power to effect social change not only in Kerala but even beyond. Narayana Guru and his successors in the Gurukula Foundation lineage provide the vantage point for the potential of the movement. The unique approach of the Guru in challenging domination without antagonizing the other nor deprecating the elegance of the self, cutting through the societal sham, offers a renewed 'advaita' accessible to all, as argued in this chapter."

    "abstract": "While most transliteration research is focused on single tokens such as named entities – e.g., transliteration of “અમદાવાદ” from the Gujarati script to the Latin script “Ahmedabad” – the informal romanization prevalent in South Asia and elsewhere often requires transliteration of full sentences. The lack of large parallel text collections of full sentence (as opposed to single word) transliterations necessitates incorporation of contextual information into transliteration via non-parallel resources, such as via mono-script text collections. \n\nIn this paper, we present a number of methods for improving transliteration in context for such a use scenario. Some of these methods in fact improve performance without making use of sentential context, allowing for better quantification of the degree to which contextual information in particular is responsible for system improvements. \n\nOur final systems, which ultimately rely upon ensembles including large pretrained language models finetuned on simulated parallel data, yield substantial improvements over the best previously reported results for full sentence transliteration from Latin to native script on all 12 languages in the Dakshina dataset (Roark et al. 2020), with an overall 3.3% absolute (18.6% relative) mean word-error rate reduction."

As social media platforms set up free manifestation of facts and thoughts in images, video, and text, there is a widespread requirement to screen them to secure groups and individuals from being exposed to offensive content that specifically targets them. In social media communications, limitless practice of vocabulary complicates the code-mixed text processing. \n\nThe most important aspiration of this research is to analyze the sentiments and classify the code-mixed social media posts/comments in the Dravidian language: Malayalam using deep learning. In this study, initial phase is the ALBERT tokenization that splits the words in the comments. Subsequently, to extract significant features from the dataset, feature extraction is carried out. Following feature extraction, feature fusion takes place using the Shannon entropy and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model. Finally, sentimental analysis and offensive text identification are conducted using the Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN). The experimentation of the proposed Feature fusion + HAN technique is performed by the metrics, namely accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, where the accuracy attained by the proposed model is 0.956, the sensitivity is 0.939, and the specificity is 0.978."

For this purpose, the concentration of radionuclides, heavy metals, net radioactivity estimation via gross alpha and beta emitters and other physiochemical characteristics were assessed in the sediments throughout the estuarine stretch. According to the results, the radionuclides had a significant effect in shaping the community structure and composition, as confirmed by the bacterial heterogeneity achieved between the samples. \n\nThe results indicate that high radioactivity in the background environment reduced the abundance and growth of normal microbial fauna and favoured only the growth of certain extremophiles belonging to families of Piscirickettsiacea, Rhodobacteriacea and Thermodesulfovibrionaceae, which were able to tolerate and adapt towards the ionizing radiation present in the environment. In contrast, communities from Comamondacea, Sphingomonadacea, Moraxellacea and Erythrobacteracea were present in the sediments collected from industrial outlet, reinforcing the potent role of radionuclides in governing the community pattern of microbes present in the natural environment. \n\nThe study confirms the presence of these novel and unidentified bacterial communities and further opens the possibility of utilising their usefulness in future prospects."

    "abstract": "Spatial and temporal distribution of microplastics (MPs) in the nearshore seafloor sediments along the Southwest coast of India and their patterns of accumulation in selected infaunal and epibenthic molluscs with diverse feeding strategies were investigated. Along the 300-km coastal stretch, which is one of the most productive and biodiversity rich regions of the eastern Arabian Sea, notable levels of MP contamination in both sediment (617.7 items/kg dry weight) and molluscs (5.39 items/g) was recorded. The concentration of MPs in sediments also varied seasonally, with a higher prevalence during the post-monsoon season. Among the four molluscan groups studied, the highest MP abundance was recorded among scavenging gastropod Pseudominolia biangulosa (9.13 items/g), followed by microcarnivore scaphopod Tesseracme quadrapicalis (5.96 items/g). In comparison, the suspension feeding bivalve, Anadara hankeyana and deposit feeding clam Jitlada philippinarum had lesser accumulation of MPs (2.98 items/g and 3.50 items/g respectively). The majority of MPs in sediments and within molluscs were less than 250 μm in size (89.14%) and were predominantly fibres and fragments. Chemical characterisation of MPs revealed eleven types of polymers dominated by polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP). Present study identified positive correlations between ingested MP polymers and the feeding strategies of molluscs. Higher values for the ecological risk assessment indices (PHI, PLI and PERI) in most of the stations indicated the severity of plastic pollution in the region. Molluscs being a major contributor to the benthic food web is also a connecting link to higher trophic levels. Hence understanding the specificity in the MPs accumulation pattern within this group has far reaching significance in utilizing them as potential bioindicators for pollution studies in marine ecosystems."

    "abstract": "When your faith begins to feel too small, too confining, you could choose to leave it. But what if the faith we inhabit is roomier than we'd thought? What if our collapsing faith is just a closet in a much larger dwelling?\n\nDisillusioned by narrow theologies, church dysfunction, and constricted readings of Scripture, people are leaving Christianity in droves. But Jesus describes the reign of God as a house with many rooms, writes author Debie Thomas, one of the most auspicious voices in religious writing today. In this work of sprawling spiritual and literary imagination, Thomas claims that wherever God dwells, there is expansiveness and belonging.\n\nThomas knows what a cramped faith feels like, what it's like to wrestle your way out of fundamentalism and toward a more capacious faith. From the diasporic church in which she grew up, which traces its lineage to the doubting disciple in India in the first century, to the disorientations of a deconstructing faith, to an ample yet orthodox Christianity that makes room for all her identities, Thomas takes readers on a deeply personal and profoundly theological odyssey. In <i>A Faith of Many Rooms</i>, she talks back to jaundiced versions of faith and finds evidence that the gospel insists on its own roominess.\n\nThe kind of God who decided to experience the world as a guest likely feels constrained by our pinched theologies too. What sorts of ruptures and revisions would it take to find a more spacious faith--and then to inhabit it with authenticity and joy? Readers of Christian Wiman, Cole Arthur Riley, and Barbara Brown Taylor will find in these pages an ardent, lyrical take on a faith transfigured."

These newer technologies blended regional and global tastes, and besides developing a new mode of viewing practices, they resulted in Malayalam films becoming popular across transnational spaces... \n\n“Faasil's rise to stardom also coincides with a period in which Kerala underwent a series of crises, including uncertainties in the economy due to the global recession of 2008, the return of expatriates owing to indigenisation in many gulf countries, geographical as well as biological disasters like the flood of 2018, Nipah virus outbreaks (2018) and later Covid-19 (2019), and many of his characters represent the uncertainties of these times. The article argues that these developments along with the shift in viewing practices aided actors like Faasil to emerge as one of the influential figures in contemporary Malayalam cinema.”"

Muslims, who make up a considerable population in South Asia, have their own grammars of birthing, mothering, and rearing children. This chapter demonstrates that maternity in South Asia is not only about the new mother and the baby but also involves various other actors, including the postnatal carer, the grandmother, neighbours, relatives and friends who partake in the larger processes in and around maternity. It specifically argues that in a largely caste-driven and patriarchal society, Muslim women of Malabar come together during and after childbirth to form informal..."

    "abstract": "The south Indian state of Kerala has a five-decade long history of large-scale circular labour migration to the Gulf. The Gulf migration has immensely changed the cultural and material scapes of Kerala. However, there is also a prevalent understanding that it is only now that we begin to understand the heavy personal and social costs to the migrants and their families at which this transformation has taken place. This work argues that the hitherto ignorance regarding the reality of the Gulf is an effect of the specific historical and structural conditions in Kerala and the Gulf which forced the Gulf experience into the realm of the private. The historical and structural conditions which consigned the Gulf as an experience to silence in public is a local manifestation of bordering that is characteristic of late capitalism. This volume takes a host of literary and visual texts by Gulf migrants, beginning in the late 1970s, to read in them the contradicting forces of staging borders on the one hand, and how the migrants sought to translate their private experience of the Gulf into a public idiom that could form affective ties with other migrants to the Gulf and the non-migrants back home. The Gulf migrant archives this work studies includes memoirs, novels, films, and personal photographs."

Malayalam is a Dravidian language, but its vocabulary has many loanwords, especially from Sanskrit. This makes phonological and lexical learning potentially challenging to young learners but also offers a way to uncover the relationships between child and adult phonologies. \n\nThis chapter discusses the salient segmental and syllable-structure properties of the core phonology of Malayalam and provides a detailed analysis of the spontaneous productions at similar ages of monolingual, Malayalam acquiring children, and bilingual, Malayalam and English acquiring children, with the two-fold aims of discovering the target properties that are manifested in the developing phonology, and recovering what the child phonologies reveal in turn about the core phonology."

    "abstract": "This chapter examines an emergent strand in Malayalam fiction that engages inadequately acknowledged dimensions of Kerala’s social history, especially linked to depressed caste communities and the practices of slavery and forced migration. \n\nThe novels and short fiction of Raju K. Vasu (b. 1959), P. F. Mathews (b. 1960), Pradeepan Pampirikkunnu (1969–2016), Johny Miranda (b. 1968), and Vinoy Thomas (b. 1975), and the earlier short fiction of C. Ayyappan (1949–2011), are prominent examples of this impulse. These writers, from Dalit, Anglo-Indian, and Luso-Indian communities, move away from social realist and modernist styles in Malayalam writing to develop new fictional imaginaries that mix fantasy and historical recall to offer a deep and conflicted engagement with contemporary Kerala. \n\nThe afterlife of dead ancestors, who were victims of caste and gender oppression, shapes the fictional world, either immobilizing the present in the tight grip of haunting or serving as a resource for the new generation’s refusal of a normalizing modernity. Spirits, curses, and benedictions appear as crucial tropes, either against the background of lower-caste conversions to Christianity—in the 16th century under Dutch and Portuguese dominance and in the 19th and 20th centuries by British and European Protestant missionaries—or through the ritual invocation of ancestors by Dalit communities in Kerala. \n\nThe chapter argues that these narratives may be seen as an important fictional response to Kerala’s history, its encounter with modernity, and the silences that accompany its self-perception as a progressive, enlightened, and liberal society."

An imperfective reading is derived when the situation argument is bound by an existential operator, signalled by the existential copula uɳʈə. A generic reading of the -unnu construction is derived when the situation argument is bound by an extensional quantifying operator. Generic sentences with -unnu contrast with the generic sentences with the future tense-marking modal particle -um. The modal marker -um is argued to signal the presence of a modalized generic operator that quantifies over the set of accessible possible worlds. This gives the sentence an intensional (characterizing) property. The modal -um is thus claimed to be closely related to the universal quantifying particle -um."

Furthermore, distinct spectral signatures emerged during different rice growth stages. The calculation of 15 indices, encompassing vegetative and water indices, yielded noteworthy variations at various physiological stages. Notably, the Leaf Area Index in Wayanad surpassed that in Alappuzha, maintaining this trend from panicle initiation to harvest stage. The spectral signatures also provided clear indications of water stress in the rice fields, with severity and mechanical processes were apparent through vegetative and water indices. Validation through conventional analysis of relative water content and membrane leakage corroborated these findings. \n\nField experiment results confirmed the significant differences in spectral reflectance based on planting methods and nutrient management treatments. The spectral signature exhibited a robust correlation with rice yield (r = 0.94), capturing variations in management practices statistically. Regression analysis revealed a strong correlation between spectral and lab-analyzed values for different physiological and nutrient parameters. \n\nIn conclusion, the developed spectral library for the rice cultivar Uma, along with the derived indices, proves instrumental in comprehending crop growth stages, identifying water or nutrient stress, and predicting the paddy yield during growing seasons, which will help for sustaining the rice production."

Moreover, the study observed a consistently high proportion of ovigerous females throughout all seasons, suggesting year-round reproductive activity in <i>H. woodmasoni</i>. \n\nSize (CL) at the onset of sexual maturity (SOM) for males and females measured 16 mm and 17 mm, respectively. In terms of brood size, the mean absolute brood size estimated in <i>H. woodmasoni</i> was 5438 ± 2687. Interestingly, while brood size increased as a power function of carapace length, the correlation between reproductive output and carapace length was found to be statistically not significant. Embryo volume varied significantly between the three developmental stages (Stage I: 0.03 ± 0.02 mm3, stage II: 0.05 ± 0.04 mm3 and stage III: 0.11 ± 0.03 mm3). The gonadosomatic index showed increasing trend corresponding ovary maturation. However, the index declined in the final maturity stage characterized by a black coloured ovary. The vivid colour changes observed in mature ovaries, spanning early vitellogenesis, late vitellogenesis and maturation phases offer valuable insights into the dynamic cellular transformations occurring during ovarian development. \n\nThe present study regarding the various reproductive traits of <i>H. woodmasoni</i> with histological examination of oogenesis will help to facilitate sustainable exploitation and adequate conservation management of this species."

    "abstract": "The Chaliyar river basin lies in the middle part of the Western Ghats, and the area extent of the basin covers the administrative sectors of Malappuram, Kozhikode, and Wayanad districts of Kerala state, India. The basin experienced 202 historical landslide inventories, such as slope failure, debris flow, mass movement, land subsidence, etc., that damaged land use, land cover, lives, and properties. Many hotspots across the various geomorphic units are frequently affected by landslides and slope failure due to sudden changes in soil properties resulting from storm surges, heavy rainfall, and other natural and man-made activities. \n\nSlope failure is a common factor causing landslide hazards in the study area. Soil characteristics and alteration of its physical properties are considered primary factors for slope instability within specific sites and times due to potentially influential phenomena such as rainfall and human impacts. \n\nIn this study, the mapping of the slope failure hazard zone is executed using a GIS-based slope stability index model (modified from the standard factor of safety equation) by analyzing soil characteristics (texture, thickness, friction, coefficient, soil unit weight, and soil-water unit weight) and other geoenvironmental parameters. \n\nThe result of the slope stability map has been divided into five zones: (1) stable zone (no risk to slope failure), (2) low-risk zone (high resistance to slope failure), (3) moderately risky zone (medium resistance to slope failure), (4) high vulnerability zone, and (5) very high vulnerability to slope failure. The areas of 25.36% and 16.28% fall under the highly vulnerable zone and extremely vulnerable zone, respectively, and the areal extent of these classes covers about 996.38km2. The uplands consist of steep valleys, barren lands, and slopes with overburdened materials. Weathered surfaces are highly susceptible to severe slope failure hazards, while altering the physical properties of the soil through external factors. The 358.64km2 (14.99%) area has been noted as moderately vulnerable to slope failure. Moreover, the areas of 18.16% (434.6km2) and 25.18% (602.38km2) have been demarcated as low vulnerability and stable zones, and these are found in low-lying plains, mid-land plateaus, and gentle slope surfaces of the basin. \n\nThe resulting map is cross-validated using historical records of landslide inventory data for the years 1980–2020, and it shows that the zones that fall under higher vulnerability are found within the proximity of landslide-occurred sites. This is very helpful for decision-making purposes in hazard zone management."

Within a buffer zone of 500m around these quarries, agricultural land comprises mixed plantations (mainly rubber and coconut), covers the maximum area, and the builtup area accounts for 17.93%. The major soil types, including laterite and hill soils, are formed from lithological formations and associated with different land use and land cover features in the quarry sites, denoting the weathering of hard rocks and their instabilities. \n\nThe land use change analysis for 18 years (2002–20) shows an overall increase in builtup areas in these districts, with an increase in quarrying activities. Panchayath-wise soil fertility status indicates that maximum quarrying sites are located within the proxy of laterite soils with a higher rate of acidic and available potassium (K), a moderate level of organic carbon, and available phosphate (P) with different land use features. \n\nThis study provides baseline information to policymakers and mining industries for taking necessary measures for eco-friendly and safe mining activities in the future."

Accordingly, groundwater quality and geochemical interactions prevailed in a black sand mineral rich coastal village is systematically presented in appraisal of drinking and industrial uses for economic engineering purposes. \n\nThe study area focused is Alappad village, Kollam, Kerala, India has numerous ecological features in a sustainable perspective. The region is unique with placer deposits where an alluvial soil aquifer–saline water–freshwater interaction occurs. This dynamics decides the pertinent hydro geochemistry, potable and designated uses of ground water in season wise. Coastal area is hereby presented based on water quality parameters predicted with the health risk assessment model with a view on human health and cancer risk due to ions (Pb, Ni, Cu, Ba, Fe, Al, Mn, Zn) in groundwater.\n\nTo ascertain industrial usage, ground water is evaluated by Langelier saturation index (LSI), Ryznar stability index (RSI), Aggressive index (AI), Larson-Skold index (LS) and Puckorius scaling index (PSI) and inferences are complemented. \n\nChemical weathering and evaporation processes are the natural factors controlling hydrochemistry of this aquifer. This complex coastal system has Nemerow pollution index (NPI) of moderate pollution for total dissolved ions of Fe and lesser for Cu, and Cr present in groundwater. LSI indicates, water is scale forming but non corrosive (46% in PRM, 20% in MON and 47% in POM). Water quality index (WQI) in POM (ranged 28.7–79.9) was excellent for drinking, followed by PRM (23.6–218.2) and MON (33.4–202.7) seasons. This groundwater bears temporary hardness with the dominance of Ca–Mg–HCO3 water type. \n\nHealth risk assessment of non-carcinogenic risk index of trace metals (Fe, Zn, Mn, and Pb) revealed, children are at ‘low risk’ and ‘medium’ risk with Ni and Cu. The carcinogenic risk index indicated 93% of samples were high Ni induced cancer risk for children, and 87% for adults due to long term ingestion (drinking water intake) pathway. Studies specific on placer mineral deposited coastal region of India are not sufficiently reported with a focus on the above perspectives. \n\nGrowing need of rare earths for material, device and energy applications, placer mineral explorations can destabilise the coastal hydrosphere. Interrelations of mineral soil – water chemistry prevailed and health hazard predicted would kindle a set of sustainable deliberations. \n\nThis study summarises the drinking and industrial use of coastal groundwater for future development and human well-being on the basis of quality criteria, corrosion proneness, water stability and health risk factors."

    "abstract": "Estuaries, which serve as vital links between land and coastal ecosystems, play a significant part in facilitating the transfer of plastic waste from the land to the ocean. In this research, we examined the prevalence, characteristics, and ecological risks of microplastics (MPs) in the extensively urbanised Cochin Estuarine System (CES), India. Additionally, it represents one of the initial evidence-based examinations of MPs ingestion by jellyfish in Indian waters, focusing on <i>Acromitus flagellatus</i>, <i>Blackfordia virginica</i>, and <i>Pleurobrachia pileus</i> species. The abundance of MPs found in the surface water of the Cochin Estuarine System (CES) varied between 14.44 ± 9 to 30 ± 15.94 MP/m3, with an average of 21.6 ± 11 MP/m3. In both surface waters and jellyfish from the Cochin Estuarine System (CES), fibers were the most prevalent type of MPs, with polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and polyamide (PA) being the most common polymer varieties. To evaluate the current levels of MPs and their effect on the CES, the Pollution Load Index (PLI), Potential Ecological Risk Index (PERI), and Polymeric Risk Index (H) were utilized. \n\nThe high PLIestuary values (20.33), high Hestuary values (234.02), and extreme PERIestuary value (1646.06) indicate that the CES is facing an extreme ecological risk. Among the 280 jellyfish individuals examined, 118 (42.14%) were recognized to contain MPs with an average of 1.54 ± 2.68 MPs/individual. Pearson bivariate analysis revealed a significant correlation between the jellyfish bell size and number of plastics per individual. Comparison between jellyfish species revealed, the majority (66%) of the MPs identified in jellyfish were from <i>A. flagellatus</i> and 44 among the 50 jellyfish examined (88%) had MPs. \n\nThese findings suggest that <i>A. flagellatus</i> may be a potential sink for MPs and may be utilized to be a bioindicator for monitoring MPs contamination in estuarine systems, aiding in future plastic pollution mitigation efforts."

    "abstract": "While walkable pedestrian infrastructure is essential for the sustainable growth of cities, the prevailing facilities in emerging countries such as India are not suitable for pedestrians. A user perception-based approach is presented here to identify intervention areas for enhancing the walkability of cities and also to prioritise catchment areas for improvement. \n\nThe methodology includes seven stages in which perception data collected from the pedestrians are subjected to fuzzy-based Importance Satisfaction Analysis (ISA). The factor structure and management schemes developed using ISA were instrumental in deriving interventions areas. \n\nThe study was conducted with reference to a road stretch of 5 km in Kollam District, Kerala, which is classified into five catchments. Among the 17 selected attributes, 12 attributes were identified as intervention areas in a single catchment, which shows the alarming situation of pedestrian infrastructure in Indian cities. The sidewalk related deficiencies were identified as common intervention areas across various catchments. Increased vehicular volume on roads, absence of guard rail, and lack of facilities for differently-abled pedestrians were the other common deficiencies. \n\nAn index is developed for prioritizing pedestrian catchments. This may be useful, especially for countries with financial constraints, to prioritise the catchments based on the need for improvement. Although the findings are city-specific, the approach and experience presented here are useful for enhancing the walkability of pedestrian infrastructure in other cities."

    "abstract": "The apparent changes in the Indian summer monsoon rainfall pattern and the nature of extreme rainfall events (EREs) in the southern Western Ghats (WG) caused widespread landslides across the region. Landslide susceptibility maps generated using the past landslide inventory are one of the efficient tools that can help mitigate the deleterious effects of landslides. Landslide susceptibility maps produced using the landslide inventory of normal and extreme rainfall years by deep neural network (DNN) modelling vary in terms of their degree of susceptibility, and the differences are prominent in the moderate and high susceptibility zones. \n\nThe DNN model trained by landslide inventory of normal rainfall years is capable of predicting landslides during EREs (with Area Under the Curve (AUC) value >0.90). The inclusion of the landslides that occurred during recent EREs (since 2018) into the existing landslide inventory provides a more accurate and refined prediction of landslide susceptibility, which facilitates risk-informed landscape planning and development of the region. \n\nIn addition, the result reveals that 13 % of the Kerala state is extremely susceptible for landslide occurrence, among this Idukki, Palakkad, Malappuram, Pathanamthitta, and Wayanad districts are highly vulnerable to the occurrence of landslides. Besides, the study also shows an increase of 3.46 % area in extreme susceptibility zone after the 2018 ERE. \n\nThe updated landslide susceptibility map of the region may be used as a vital tool for planning landslide mitigation activities in the wake of recurrent EREs and associated landslide occurrences."

    "abstract": "Rural fishing communities face numerous challenges related to livelihood security, as they are engaged in a risky and labour-intensive occupation. They often receive only a small portion of the profits, due to the influence of self-serving local intermediaries, lack of transparency in the business processes, trust issues, and power differentials among stakeholders. Although still in its infancy, blockchain technology has been adopted in various urban settings to mitigate similar challenges and to build trust through its security attributes, data ledger transparency, and smart contract automation. Yet, few have explored the efficacy of blockchain technology in addressing the unique challenges faced by rural fishermen in marketing their catch and connecting them to a broader range of customers for improved livelihood resilience. \n\nThis study aims to examine how the livelihood resilience of fishermen can be increased through the potential of a blockchain, in a fishing community in the coastal village of Alappad in Kerala, India. Thematic analysis of data acquired from 43 semi-structured qualitative interviews and participatory rural appraisal tools revealed five categories of challenges: business cost and profitability, government regulations, low education and digital illiteracy, socio-cultural limitations, and over-dependence on middlemen as inhibitors to fishermen's livelihoods. \n\nThe study proposes a blockchain-based e-commerce framework to mitigate selected challenges that emerged due to a lack of trust and transparency in the local fish market. It contributes to rural development by exploring an innovative, solution aligned with five UN Sustainable Development Goals, in contrast to the Business-as-usual approach in offering technological solutions."

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic outbreak and the subsequent restrictive measures such as lockdown/shutdown have gravely impacted everyday life by suspending regular activities. This unprecedented situation has also led to a potential reorganization of social practices. The distinction between social spaces such as work, education, entertainment and family became linear, and the superseding of public, private and leisure time was evident. As a vibrant public space that plays a significant role in the personal and social life of the public, libraries had to explore novel methods to continue their services and social role during the lockdown period. This paper discusses rural public libraries in Kerala, India, by exploring their modalities of work execution and program organization during the pandemic-affected lockdown period between 2020–2022. The paper seeks to find out how the rural libraries of Kerala managed to engage in their daily services, focusing on how these libraries utilized digital media technologies and social networking sites in day-to-day activities. Based on the in-depth interviews with eleven local librarians this study explains different approaches planned and executed by the libraries to reach out to their readers and how these attempts mobilized and integrated the public to respond."

Awareness about this among pregnant ladies and their caregivers from the antenatal period may help to overcome some of these difficulties.\n\nObjective: To compare the effect of the implementation of an antenatal breast milk care bundle on the availability of adequate breast milk on day 7 for preterm babies ≤ 32 weeks when compared to a postnatal breast milk care bundle alone.\n\nMethodology: This prospective study was conducted among neonates ≤32 weeks born in Government Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram from January 2021 to May 2022. Antenatal bundles were implemented in the antenatal OPDs and wards. Postnatal bundles were implemented in the NICU and postnatal wards. The outcome was compared among babies of mothers who got both the care bundles and those who received only the postnatal care bundle.\n\nResults: A total of 110 babies were included in the study. There was a 1.32 times increase in the adequacy of milk volume on day 7 (CI: 1.04–1.68), a significant increase in the proportion of mothers expressing within 24 hours, and babies getting discharged on exclusive MOM in those who received the antenatal BMC bundles. The risk for inadequate milk volume was high in those who have <2 ml of milk at 48 hours (RR: 1.67, CI:1.26–2.20].\n\nConclusion: Antenatal breast milk care bundles can increase the availability of adequate MOM for preterm babies."

Hence, it is crucial to monitor systematically, the degree of radioactivity in the ecosystem and possible radiological health hazards. \n\nThe present study attempt to investigate the dynamics of prominent radionuclides and various radiological parameters associated with terrestrial gamma radiations along the littoral regions of Kollam District, a well-reported high background radiation area in India. \n\nThe gamma radiation exposure rate along the coastal belt of Kollam was measured using a portable Micro-R-survey meter and associated radiological parameters have been calculated and compared with the global average values. \n\nThe result indicates that the radiological parameters cross the safe limits recommended by the UNSCEAR 2000. A high value is found in the shoreline of Chavara, with a maximum absorbed dose rate of 11 945.1nGyh−1. The monazite-enriched black sand widely distributed all along the coast, which contains natural radioisotopes such as 40K, 226Ra and 232Th, has greatly contributed to the increase in radiation levels in the regions."

    "abstract": "Evolutionary event has not only altered the genetic structure of human populations but also associated with social and cultural transformation. South Asian populations were the result of migration and admixture of genetically and culturally diverse groups. Most of the genetic studies pointed to large-scale admixture events between Ancestral North Indian (ANI) and Ancestral South Indian (ASI) groups, also additional layers of recent admixture. \n\nIn the present study, we have analyzed 213 individuals inhabited in South-west coast India with traditional warriors and feudal lord status and historically associated with migratory events from North/North West India and possible admixture with West Eurasian populations, whose genetic links are still missing. \n\nAnalysis of autosomal Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) markers suggests that these groups possibly derived their ancestry from some groups of North West India having additional Middle Eastern genetic components. Higher distribution of West Eurasian mitochondrial haplogroups also points to female-mediated admixture. \n\nEstimation of Effective Migration Surface (EEMS) analysis indicates Central India and Godavari basin as a crucial transition zone for population migration from North and North West India to South-west coastal India. Selection screen using 3 distinct outlier-based approaches revealed genetic signatures related to Immunity and protection from Viral infections. \n\nThus, our study suggests that the South-west coastal groups with traditional warriors and feudal lords’ status are of a distinct lineage compared to Dravidian and Gangetic plain Indo-Europeans and are remnants of very early migrations from North West India following the Godavari basin to Karnataka and Kerala."

    "abstract": "In India, the rapid economic development has resulted in a change in the lifestyle of urban dwellers, which has changed the composition of the waste generated. Due to the high volume of waste generated, the collection, transportation, and disposal stream requires a highly efficient\nsystem. It requires knowledge of what the wastes are comprised of, how they need to be collected and disposed of, and the participation of citizens, local governments, and private entrepreneurs. \n\nWith the vision to transform Kerala into a garbagefree state and achieve full-scale environmental health, Kerala has notified the principle of 3Rs in the State Policy on Solid Waste Management. As per Suchitwa Mission annual report 2019-2020, in the year 2019-2020 Kerala has generated 10,044 TPD of Municipal Solid Waste. With a population growth rate of approximately 10.24%, Kerala could generate 16,565 TPD of waste in 2036. This increase in waste generation could put substantial pressure on the existing waste management system of Kerala. Thus, there is a greater need to investigate alternative waste management options and expand the capacity of the waste management system in Kerala. \n\nLandfills have also been widely unsuccessful in the state of Kerala. According to the Suchitwa mission' s latest data, Kerala has 51 notified dumpsites of which only 31 are in operation and 14 dumpsites have a volume≤ 800 m3. Additionally few dumpsites are very close to human settlements and located close to each other. In the current article a detailed review of the waste generation, composition, organic waste treatment and disposal methods are made, and gaps in the present waste management practice are outlined. The identified gaps are examined to fulfill the defined requirements in the solid waste management law of the respective state and the comprehensive rules laid down by the Government of India (Gol) in its Solid Waste Management Rules 2016."

    "abstract": "The management of faecal sludge in cities without a sewerage system is a challenging problem that requires immediate attention. The high organic and nutrient content, pathogen load, and pharmaceutical residues in faecal sludge necessitate special attention for its treatment to ensure\nenvironmental and public health safety. Onsite treatment of faecal sludge with a focus on resource recovery is a sustainable approach to its management. However, studies in these areas are limited, particularly in the Indian context. \n\nIn this study, the aim is to generate primary data on the\ncurrent status of faecal sludge management in a model region without a sewerage network. Additionally, kinetic parameters were examined to design an anaerobic bioprocess and an engineered system for resource-oriented faecal sludge treatment. One of the wards in Thiruvananthapuram Corporation, Kerala was selected for the study. Fresh faecal sludge collected from an apartment complex was used for the experimental studies. \n\nAnaerobic treatment of fresh faecal sludge was validated in bench-scale experimental bioreactors using different combinations: with mixing without inoculum, with mixing with inoculum, without mixing without inoculum, and without mixing with inoculum. \n\nThe primary focus was on monitoring the organic removal efficiency as Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) of these combinations. Among the four combinations tested the units \"without mixing with inoculum\" and \"with mixing with inoculum\" demonstrated COD removal efficiencies of 20.89% and 18.91%, respectively, with a first-order rate constant of 0.0008 hr-1 for both combinations. The other combinations exhibited comparatively lower COD removal efficiency and rate constants. \n\nSince the combinations with mixing and inoculum showed higher COD removal efficiency, either of them can be adopted for design purposes. Based on these results, a combined anaerobic-aerobic treatment unit is proposed for the treatment of faecal sludge."

    "abstract": "Background: Heterogeneous outcome correlations across treatment arms and clusters have been increasingly acknowledged in cluster randomized trials with binary endpoints, where analytical methods have been developed to study such heterogeneity. However, cluster-specific outcome variances and correlations have yet to be studied for cluster randomized trials with continuous outcomes.\n\nMethods: This article proposes models fitted in the Bayesian setting with hierarchical variance structure to quantify heterogeneous variances across clusters and explain it with cluster-level covariates when the outcome is continuous. The models can also be extended to analyzing heterogeneous variances in individually randomized group treatment trials, with arm-specific cluster-level covariates, or in partially nested designs. Simulation studies are carried out to validate the performance of the newly introduced models across different settings.\n\nResults: Simulations showed that overall the newly introduced models have good performance, reporting low bias and approximately 95% coverage for the intraclass correlation coefficients and regression parameters in the variance model. When variances are heterogeneous, our proposed models had improved model fit over models with homogeneous variances. When used to analyse data from the Kerala Diabetes Prevention Program study, our models identified heterogeneous variances and intraclass correlation coefficients across clusters and examined cluster-level characteristics associated with such heterogeneity.\n\nConclusion: We proposed new hierarchical Bayesian variance models to accommodate cluster-specific variances in cluster randomized trials. The newly developed methods inform the understanding of how an intervention strategy is implemented and disseminated differently across clusters and can help improve future trial design."

    "abstract": "As global population ages, “Ageing in Place” is prioritised as the top ageing strategy for many of the older adults worldwide. India, being a nation that is expected to hold the maximum share of the older adult population in the near future, has a huge responsibility vested in it to take care of the needs of older adults. The social structure of the nation has emphasised the importance of older adults to age in place, experiencing all the independence and autonomy at their own dwelling places for as long as possible. \n\nThis study aims to provide a profound understanding of the meaning, attitude, and perceptions of older adults toward aging in place. Using a qualitative research design, in-depth interviews were conducted among 15 community-dwelling older adults who chose ageing in place in Kerala, India. Following the interviews, thematic network analysis was done, inspired by Jennifer Attride-Stirling. Three global themes were derived, which include the older adults’ perspectives on (1) determinants of aging in place, (2) challenges of aging in place, and (3) strategies for successful aging in place. \n\nThe study evokes in-depth exploration of the experiences of older adults aging in place, which inform future evidence-based practices and policy-level implications."

The most common antibiotics prescribed were topical metronidazole (44%) and penicillins (29%). Among patients who died, 5% were prescribed antibiotics within the final month of life. In total, 32% of antibiotic prescriptions were documented in AOFs, and 18% were concordant with all institutional antibiotic prescribing guidelines.\n\nConclusions: This study is the first to analyse an antibiotic stewardship intervention in a palliative care setting within a low- and middle-income country. This retrospective study provides a benchmark of antibiotic use within Indian palliative care and highlights areas for future stewardship research including topical metronidazole use within palliative care and higher rates of antibiotic use among younger palliative care patients."

    "abstract": "India’s economic reforms of 1991 were a radical shift from the dysfunctional development strategy and a move away from the socialistic approach that the country had followed in the previous decades. The reform measures significantly changed lives by improving living conditions and alleviating poverty. The economic reforms of 1991 are considered a boon to the state of Kerala, which was facing severe constraints in sourcing finance for infrastructure projects. \n\nThis research attempts to establish a cause-and-effect relationship between foreign direct investment (FDI), infrastructure development, and economic growth during the pre- and post-reforms period in the state. The study explores this issue using econometric analysis done on time-series data from 1970 to 2020. It analyses the impact of infrastructure financing on infrastructure development and economic growth at an aggregate level considering the state as a unit of analysis, using a multivariate method. \n\nThe results of the research indicate that infrastructure development and economic growth have a positive moderate relationship with change in FDI. The findings may be used as reference material for further research on the impact of investments on economic development."

    "abstract": "Background: Child abuse and neglect is an issue of concern for public health professionals. The impact of abuse may lead to poor physical and mental health conditions. Family environment may impact coping and recovery among victims of abuse. The association between child abuse, mental health, happiness, and family environment is complex. The study examines the association and pathways between child abuse exposure, mental health and happiness, while exploring the potentially mediating effect of the family environment.\n\nMethods: Data were collected from 571 high school students from Kerala, India, by using various tools, including a semi-structured questionnaire, Depression and Anxiety Youth Scale, and happiness scale. A mediation analysis using structural equation modeling (SEM) was carried out to test the objectives of the study.\n\nResults: The analysis shows that mental health, happiness, and family environment are correlated with abuse experience. The mediation analysis further shows that the indirect effect of abuse on mental health via the family environment was significant (β = 0.013, 95% CI [0.002, 0.033]). The indirect effect of abuse on happiness via the family environment was significant (β = –0.019, 95% CI [–0.044, –0.003]). Furthermore, the total effect of abuse on mental health (β = 0.266, 95% CI [0.164, 0.354]) and abuse on happiness (β = –0.152, 95% CI [–0.259, –0.050]) was significant.\n\nConclusion: The study reveals that abuse experiences impact happiness and mental health outcomes among students. The family environment mediates the relationship between child abuse and mental health, and between child abuse and happiness."

    "abstract": "The increase in population and rapid economic development activities increase vulnerability along the coastal areas. Coastal zones are among the planet’s most dynamic regions and are susceptible to natural and anthropogenic hazards. To comprehend how risks and hazards are distributed spatially along the coast, coastal vulnerability assessment is crucial. This study aims at identifying the vulnerable zones along the coast of Kerala, India. \n\nFor this, the coastal vulnerability index (CVI) is calculated by considering the physical, geological, and socio-economic parameters. The physical-geological parameters considered are nearshore bed slope, shoreline change rate, coastal elevation, tidal range, and continental shelf width. The socio-economic parameters include population density, road network, and land use/land cover. Analytical hierarchy process (AHP) is used for obtaining weights for physical-geological and socio-economic parameters. \n\nCoastal vulnerability results show that 82.40 km of the coastal stretch has a very high CVI value along the coast of Kerala, accounting for 13.87% of the total coastline. The most vulnerable stretches are along the coast of Kozhikode, Malappuram, Thrissur, Ernakulam, Alappuzha, and Trivandrum districts while Kasargod and Kannur districts have no coastal stretches with very high CVI. \n\nHigh population density, low nearshore bed slope, low coastal elevation, high erosion rates, built-up areas, and roads near to the coastline are some of the factors contributing to very high CVI in coastal districts of Kerala."

Information on CA in cropping systems involving elephant foot yam (<i>Amorphophallus paeoniifolius</i> (Dennst.) Nicolson), an important tuber crop, is lacking. Hence, this study aimed to determine the effect of CA in elephant foot yam on crop–weed dynamics, nutrient uptake, and soil microclimate. \n\nField experiments were conducted in randomised block design over two seasons at ICAR-Central Tuber Crops Research Institute, Thiruvananthapuram, in elephant foot yam (var. Gajendra) intercropped with banana (var. Robusta) with five treatments viz., conservation organic, conservation chemical, conventional chemical, existing conventional [package of practices (POP) as control], and existing organic package. \n\nThe weed flora was dominated by broad-leaved weeds. By the fourth month, conservation chemical practice reduced the weed density by 58.8% and weed biomass by 55% over existing POP. The total biomass production and its partitioning to corms, uptake of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K), crop growth rate, corm bulking rate, and harvest index of elephant foot yam did not differ significantly under conservation or conventional practices but were higher in conservation chemical practice. The N, P, and K physiological efficiencies were higher in conventional chemical treatment. The soil microclimate was improved, with higher soil CO2 flux and soil moisture in conservation organic or organic plots. \n\nThe study proved that conservation practices involving reduced tillage, residue retention, and use of herbicides was a viable alternative in banana + elephant foot yam system."

The aim of this study was to gather knowledge on dietary choices and the foraging behaviour of the Grizzled Giant Squirrel (<i>Ratufa macroura</i>) in Chinnar Wildlife Sanctuary, Southern Western Ghats, Kerala, India. The objectives were in particular to determine the food composition, seasonal fluctuations in food selection and feeding technique. \n\nThrough an observational sampling method, focal animal sampling, the Grizzled Giant Squirrel in Chinnar Wildlife Sanctuary was found to feed on 30 plant species belonging to 18 families. The most used plant family was Fabaceae, with eight species, followed by Moraceae (four species) and Anacardiaceae (two species). The food species consumed included 22 trees, four climbers, one liana, one paraphyte, one shrub and one succulent species. The squirrel spent the most time feeding on <i>Bauhinia racemosa</i> (19.79%), followed by <i>Tamarindus indica</i> (14.08%) and <i>Nothopegia beddomei</i> (9.89%). The squirrel's diet choice was primarily influenced by the availability of food tree species and food resources rather than the season and nontree species were also found in the diet of Grizzled Giant Squirrel. \n\nAlthough the Grizzled Giant Squirrel exhibits some plasticity in its dietary choices, the available diversity of mature trees and plants as food sources appears to be important for its conservation in the fragmented riparian forest of the Western Ghats in Southern India."

    "abstract": "This article attempts to explain how the parliamentary left interacted with the social terrain of Kerala, which has a strong presence of organised social pressure groups. \n\nKerala has a unique political landscape where radical left politics coexist with reactionary community forces. The early 20th-century social reform movement has the credit of producing two parallel but antagonistic traditions that influenced modern Kerala politics more or less equally. The scholars have been polarised into two groups to explain what dominates Kerala politics—class or caste. \n\nThis work explicates these complexities by analysing how the Communist Party engaged with the communities with the help of the literature on the democratic approach to social diversity. It tracks the evolution of the communist movement in Kerala in establishing and broadening its social base. \n\nIt employs primary and secondary resources to examine the subject in question thoroughly. The primary resources used in the article are interviews with significant party leaders and ideologues. In doing so, this work argues that the Communist Party carefully balanced the ideological commitment to an integrationist approach to diversity on the one hand and a practical requirement for social accommodation and recognition on the other hand."

It argues that recovery processes implemented by the state are embedded in unequal social and economic power relations. Post-disaster situations can therefore mimic pre-disaster vulnerabilities and inequalities. \n\nIf attempts to restore normalcy are not accompanied by efforts to unmask unequal social and economic power relations, post-disaster recovery can result in the re-institutionalisation of marginality and social vulnerability. Post-disaster recovery therefore needs to be viewed as a social process that is to be informed by discourses around social inequalities. It also needs to take a critical view of the concept of ‘normalcy’."

The construction of a regional or sub-national identity is explored from the spatial and social configurations of the ‘outside’ and the ‘other’ within the region as imagined by the Malayali public. \n\nThis article also focuses on the popular imaginings of the assemblage of ‘Bengali migrants’ in these films and their significance in the larger societal spectrum.

These are two states which I have visited several times, consorting with activist-scholars such as John Kurien in Kerala and Nityanand Jayaraman in Tamil Nadu. The selection of environmental conflicts offered here attests to the strength of the environmental justice movement in Southern India and in India as a whole, beyond the old relevant short-list of the 1970s and 1980s, namely the Chipko movement, the Appiko movement, the Silent Valley controversy, the Narmada Bachao Andolan, the Bhopal struggle ‒ important as they were. Just only in the “small” state of Kerala (population of 35 million) the EJAtlas gathers around 20 socio-environmental conflicts, some of them so significant internationally as the Fishworkers struggle. \n\nSome other cases in Kerala on biodiversity conservation are analysed in Chapter 11."

    "abstract": "Existing literature suggests significant disparities in health expenditure incurred by households receiving health services. To determine fair contributions by beneficiaries, it is crucial to understand the existing inequalities in the context of financial protection measures and the factors influencing them. This exploratory study looks at how catastrophic health expenditures (CHE) are distributed across economic groups. The study also casts light on what drives the inequalities in the incidences of CHE. \n\nThe study uses unit-level data from the 75th round of the National Sample Survey fielded periodically by the Government of India. It employs logistic regression to study factors affecting CHE. Furthermore, the concentration index and its regression-based decomposition are employed to have a sense of inequality and the factors driving it. \n\nThe findings reveal socioeconomic inequality in CHE incidence and highlight the contribution of medical institutions (whether public or private) and consumption expenditure of households to the total inequality. \n\nThe present study, while critically looking at the pre-existing inequalities, highlights the shortcomings of health financing in urban areas and calls for a reconsideration of extant policy designs. The study maintains that factors outside the control of the health system may be responsible for disparities in catastrophic medical spending. Therefore, to reduce the burden of catastrophic health spending and its inequalities, future policy measures must take into account both elements within the health system and those outside of it."

    "abstract": "We construct a panel of 242 households from five consecutive Kerala Migration Surveys that span 20 years at five-year intervals to study the fundamental determinants of the decision to migrate abroad as well as the decision to remit. Accounting for time-invariant unobservables and allowing migration and remittance behaviour to depend upon previous choices clarifies our understanding of both decisions. \n\nMigration and remittance behaviour display positive serial correlation over a five-year time horizon, and the presence of a return migrant in the household increases the likelihood of migration by 13% and remittances by 4%. Migration is 1% more likely in female-headed households, 4% less likely when the household head is employed, increases by 0.4% for each additional year of the household head's age, and is 6% more likely in households that are asset-poor. \n\nRemittances are between 20% and 70% more likely to obtain when the migrant was married at the time of migration and 3% less likely when the household head is employed, the latter suggesting either an old-age security or a co-insurance motive. Evidence in favour of a very strong inheritance competition motive is found in that each additional male heir increases the likelihood of remittances by between 8% and 31%. \n\nBased on our econometric evidence, and in particular our findings pertaining to serial correlation and the presence of a return migrant in the household, it is likely that both migration from and remittances to Kerala will quickly rebound to their pre-pandemic levels."

    "abstract": "To emerge as a dominant socio-technological regime, agroecological transitions require supportive public policies and collective agroecological actions, with refinement in scientific/technological practices, cultures, markets, and user preferences. \n\nUsing a multi-level perspective approach, this study inquires why the proper positioning of these determinants is substantial in transforming niche innovations in agroecology into a dominant regime by replacing vicious cycles associated with enriching agribusiness with virtuous cycles that support regional ecologies and communities. \n\nThe models of agroecological transition during the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods in Kerala and how the political agroecological position during the latter period succeeded in enabling a transition were examined. Owing to the landscape turbulence caused by COVID-19, the Government of Kerala triggered the de/realignment of determinants toward agroecological transition through programs, strategies, and nudges using a bottom-up approach under the ‘Subhiksha Keralam’ (Self Sufficient Kerala) project. \n\nAt the agroecosystem level, Characteristics of Agroecological Transition was used to quantify the magnitude of transition, the results demonstrating an improvement in farms during the COVID-19 period. The majority of homestead farms were characterised as agroecological, either in transition or advanced. Agroecological transition became possible because the government systematically targeted user preferences and societal values, along with modifying policy and technology, through nudges, thereby preventing possible lock-ins."

    "abstract": "People are increasingly sharing and expressing their emotions using online social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube. An abusive, hateful, threatening, and discriminatory act that makes discomfort targets gay, lesbian, transgender, or bisexual individuals is called Homophobia and Transphobia. Detecting these types of acts on social media is called Homophobia and Transphobia Detection. This task has recently gained interest among researchers. Identifying homophobic and transphobic content for under-resourced languages is a bit challenging task. There are no such resources for Malayalam and Hindi to categorise these types of content as far now. \n\nThis paper presents a new high-quality dataset for detecting homophobia and transphobia in Malayalam and Hindi languages. Our dataset consists of 5,193 comments in Malayalam and 3,203 comments in Hindi. We also submitted the experiments performed with traditional machine learning and transformer-based deep learning models on the Malayalam, Hindi, English, Tamil, and Tamil-English datasets."

    "abstract": "This study presents a novel parametric-non parametric composite approach for developing Multivarite Trophic State Index (MTSI) for the classification of lentic water bodies (LWB). The newly developed framework involves the use of water quality parameters (WQPs), Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Non-Parametric Gaussian Kernal Density (NPGKD) estimator. The generic framework is demonstrated for developing MTSI, based on the datasets of 18 LWBs in Kerala, India. The method could capture the hypereutrophic status and Akkulam lake was found to be in this state and three other lakes are in eutrophic state for the 2012–2018 database used in this study. The method of developing MTSI is generic and with discrete threshold values which enable its application to any hydroclimatic region. \n\nSubsequently, a novel Machine Learning based framework is proposed for prediction of MTSI considering WQPs as inputs. Four machine learning methods and the linear regression are applied for the prediction of MTSI of LWBs of Kerala, considering six combinations of input datasets of WQPs. The rigorous performance evaluation based on multitude of error, coefficient and graphical measures confirmed the superiority of Random Forest as the best method for the prediction of MTSI, for the chosen database. The combination of nine WQPs involving both physical and chemical parameters is found to be the best for MTSI prediction and machine learning offers flexibility to get comparable performance even with lesser number of input variables."

A freely available global dataset is used for obtaining river geometry information and topographic information is obtained from ASTER/SRTM DEM and localised LiDAR DEM. \n\nWe evaluated the proposed model using the ground observed flood points from the state disaster management agency for Kerala and flood maps published by USGS for Louisiana. \n\nThe proposed model captured ∼ 45% of flooding during peak flood days while taking ∼ 15 min for each run on a daily time step on a desktop computer."

    "abstract": "The framework of ‘lived Islam’ overshadows the study of Islam in South Asia, presupposing a ‘local Islam’ against a ‘global Islam’. In the post-9/11 context, the global is immediately associated with the political and the political with the undesirable. On the other hand, the local is portrayed as peaceful, accommodative and, hence, desirable. Such teleological approaches produce a priori desire for the local and undermine the political, foreclosing Muslim political legitimacy. \n\nBy shifting attention to the Muslim movements in Kerala, I emphasise the significance of the political and jurisprudence in the exploration of Muslim lives.\n\nI conclude that while the Muslim subjectivity is decisively framed within the constraints of security concerns, Hindu sensibility, and modern citizenship, jurisprudence enables the Muslim subject to engage substantially within and beyond these constellations of power, imagining a sovereign register of Islamic ethos."

    "abstract": "It might not be amiss to observe that, <i>Nayattu</i>, the Malayalam movie by filmmaker Martin Prakkat rides its last lap on the breathtaking suspense of a suspension of justice set in the backdrop of Indian electoral politics. Such suspense or suspension is hardly unanticipated in the writings of Jacques Derrida for whom the reasoning of democracy is of ‘a certain reason to come, as democracy to come’. Rather than eager anticipation ready to bear fruit, the reasoning of democracy is the contrary. It is the impossibility of ever bearing fruit which is portrayed through the executive’s insensitivity and domineeringness towards ordinary man’s justice. \n\nSeveral other characteristics also make the movie a worthwhile analysis in this frame. It is the story of the sheer inadequacy of traditional democratic institutions in fulfilling their role—three police officers who are wrongly accused need to run to the valley/hill outside the walls of the ‘city’ in search of a place of refuge that is never to be found. However, it is the portrayal of Dalits both as the mob and as the victimised that contributes to the tempo of the movie."

    "abstract": "Religious conversion and marriage across communal lines have long been contentious in India. The contemporary debate on ‘Love Jihad’ – the Hindu Nationalist conspiracy theory that accuses Muslim men of waging a religious war by seducing and converting unsuspecting Hindu brides – exemplifies the simultaneously geopolitical and biopolitical anxiety that religious conversion inspires. \n\nIn this paper, I focus on the case of Hadiya, a young woman from Kerala, who, in 2016, found herself remanded first to her university’s hostel – as dormitories are called in India – and then to her parents’ home as various courts debated on the authenticity of her conversion to Islam, and her marriage to a Muslim partner. \n\nThrough an examination of media discourse and court records in this case, the paper argues that in ‘Love Jihad’, the domestic and the carceral are rendered inextricably intertwined through an affective politics that presents desire outside the bounds of caste and religion as geopolitically misoriented. \n\nDrawing on Sara Ahmed’s work on the phenomenology of orientation, I focus on the intimate geographies of the hostel, which I argue exemplifies a site of carceral convergence between nation and family, in the management of the affective disorder associated with religious conversion."

    "abstract": "The paper explored the dignity and human rights violations faced by women domestic workers in India at their workplaces through an intersectional lens. \n\nThe country has over 50 million domestic workers, primarily women, who face multiple structural vulnerabilities at work. The existing literature on domestic workers focused more on the violations of economic labour rights. The subjective experience of daily loss of dignity, humiliation, and human rights violations at the workplace remains relatively unexplored in India. \n\nIn this context, a survey was conducted among 600 women domestic workers from three selected States – 200 each in Mizoram, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala. The research team held six focus group discussions with domestic workers and ten in-depth interviews with NGO personnel and activists. A mixed methodology approach was employed, wherein quantitative and qualitative tools were used, followed by data integration to outline the phenomena under enquiry. \n\nThe study identified multiple forms of restrictions and prohibitions in the workspaces through which discrimination and humiliation of domestic workers occur, violating their rights and dignity. \n\nThe paper argues that women domestic workers are highly vulnerable to exploitation, and their identity in terms of gender, caste, class, and ethnicity, creates complex forms of intersectional disadvantages. The feminisation of domestic work and the consequent devaluation of work make the intersectional disadvantages, humiliation, harassment, and exploitation generally invisible. \n\nThe scenario calls for multi-stakeholder interventions and social action to create decent workspaces to improve the working conditions and social well-being of women domestic workers."

It also demonstrates how the Church, which continues to be a dominant institution influencing the personal and political lives of Syrian Christians, has become an arena for left-behind men to reassert their patriarchal status at home and in the community."

Platform work is a preferred job option for the young workforce as the mean age of the surveyed is 27.45 years. Though platform work is opted by all irrespective of educational level, those with higher educational qualifications were engaged in web-based work. \n\nGender bias in favour of women is found in web-based work, while location-based jobs happen to be a male dominion. Though platform workers value independence in work, flexible work schedules, etc., associated with gig work, most of them have expressed their desire to have a regular job with stable incomes as the mean income of the respondents was moderate at ₹17,609. Reckoning the rise in platform job options, the policy thrust must be on promoting remunerative web-based work coupled with protecting the interests of the overworked location-based workers."

    "abstract": "Objectives: The objectives of this study include assessing the motorcycle helmet use pattern in Calicut, India, and analyzing the factors influencing helmet use including motorcyclists' perceptions.Methods: Field observational studies at 15 locations were conducted to determine the helmet use rate among motorcyclists and pillion passengers. A structured questionnaire interview survey was conducted with 709 motorcyclists to evaluate the users' perceptions and opinions regarding the use of motorcycle helmets.Results: There was a considerable difference in the level of motorcycle helmet use observed between the locations within and outside the city limits, where different levels of helmet law enforcement were exercised. The helmet use was observed at a maximum of 89% within the city and a minimum of 23% in some locations outside the city. The decreasing percentage of helmet use while moving toward the locations outside the city was confirmed statistically through t tests (t = 1.771, df = 13, P < .05). It was found that only 42% of users revealed that helmets are comfortable and 42% expressed that helmets affect hearing ability. It is important to note that 57% of users are of the opinion that there is no need to use a helmet if you drive slowly and carefully. The price of the helmet was not a deterrent for helmet use. In addition, it was observed that only 45% of helmets used by the motorist were standard helmets with an Indian Standards Institute (ISI) mark.Conclusion: The widely varying helmet use pattern observed in the study area may be attributed due to the users' behaviors; that is, using a helmet only when the helmet law is strictly enforced rather than using a helmet as a protective device. Further, some of the problems and beliefs associated with helmet use prevent motorcyclists from using a helmet. Hence, the road safety of motorcyclists can be improved only through addressing the identified measures comprehensively."

The results show that male riders are significantly more involved in drunken driving and cell phone usage, while female riders are significantly more inclined to helmet usage and family involvement. \n\nThe age of the rider shows significant difference on cell phone usage. The educational level of the rider exhibits significant difference on all six variables. Riders educated up to degree and above degree levels are found to be more inclined to helmet usage, while drunken driving, cell phone usage, and negligence of vehicle examination are found to be appreciably low among them compared to riders educated up to Grade 10 and Grade 12. \n\nResults of this study can be used to conduct appraisal and counselling programmes about unsafe and risky driving acts resulting from drunken drive, helmet non-usage, cell phone usage while driving, and negligence of PTW examination among male and young riders educated up to Grade 12."

    "abstract": "Objective: This study aimed to measure the prevalence of drugs of abuse (DOA) among the goods carriage drivers associated with the southern State of India, Kerala.\n\nMethods: Point-of-collection testing (POCT) of oral fluid collected from the participants (n = 249) was done using the Evidence MultiSTAT DOA Oral Fluid II Assay kits and the Evidence MultiSTAT analyzer.\n\nResults: Out of the total samples, 53 (21.29%) were positive for one or more DOA. A high prevalence of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) (10.04%) and synthetic cannabinoids were detected in the samples. The use of ketamine, alpha-PVP, LSD, methamphetamine, opiate, 6-MAM, benzodiazepines I, methadone, PCP, tramadol, and amphetamine was also detected and their frequency of use ranged between 4.02 and 0.80%. \n\nAn association between drug abuse and distance of travel was found in drivers in this study, χ2 (5, N = 249) = 123.5, p < 0.001. Confirmatory analysis using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry showed excellent agreement with the results of the screening test.\n\nConclusions: This was the first study conducted among drivers in India for the detection of DOA. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) was used more by the goods carriage drivers associated with Kerala State, India. The use of psychoactive substances significantly increased with the distance of travel. Point-of-collection testing (POCT) by the biochip array technology is an efficient method for the detection of these substances."

    "abstract": "Financial loss due to road traffic accidents is very huge in India; yet, remarkable studies were not done to quantify the loss. In this study, an effort is made through a Stated Preference (SP) survey to know how users value the safety. The amount of money that the road users are ready to contribute for a secured transportation facility is derived from these data. \n\nThe SP data were collected from two-wheeler riders in Calicut, Kondotty and Manjeri. Attributes included in the SP experiment were time and cost of travel and number of traffic accidents in a year and the WTP values are calculated through binary logit analysis. \n\nIt was observed that travel cost, accident rate of the route selected, age, occupation, personal income and number of household members have significant impact on the decision-making process. WTP value of a road accident for a two-wheeler user was found to be Rs 0.4232/person/trip."

However, the sheer scale and pace at which affected communities are now able to mobilise resources and social support reveal the role of communication technology in crisis management.\n\nUsing the case study of the great deluge in Kerala, this article describes the stages of crowdsourcing that unfolded during the rescue and relief phases, and analyses how technology facilitated this process. The article also demonstrates how simple technologies that are aligned with the local specificities of the context are often more effective in disaster management than technologically advanced equipment."

    "abstract": "The United Planters' Association of South India (UPASI), formed in 1893 at the zenith of British colonial rule in India, was an organization dedicated to the interests of British planters, mainly tea planters, of South India. In the first half century of its history, UPASI enjoyed an unusual degree of effectiveness and control. Its authority and reach owed to the fact that, unlike many other planters' organizations of the time, such as the Ceylon Planters' Association and the Planters' Association of Malay, UPASI was an “association of associations,” a cartel of cartels, its members being district associations. But its power also derived from the homogeneous ethnic composition of the firms that constituted and managed this body, making it an exclusive association of Europeans in an Indian world. In this article, I show how this combination of ethnicity and cooperation, dynamics that manifested across the entire range of modern businesses started in colonial India, proved to be both a source of strength and a point of weakness."

One of the crucial World Bank aided and the most significant Irrigation projects in Kerala\nis centred on the Kallada River, and now this project is benefited for in 92 villages. However, it is essential to monitor the water quality of the Kallada River. The focus of the present study is to assess the water quality of the Kallada River using caddisflies (Trichoptera) as well as physicochemical\nparameters of water. Samples of caddisflies and water were collected from 6 sites in the river to monitor water quality during the pre-monsoon season. Altogether, more than 3000 specimens belonging to 5 different taxa were recorded. A multivariate statistical approach was applied to study\nthe influences of the water quality on caddisflies fauna. The results indicate that the upstream supported community abundance than the downstream. Less abundance of caddisflies was observed in the midstream and downstream sites Punalur and West Kallada, respectively. Caddisflies were absent\nin the sixth site Koivila, resulting from saltwater intrusion from the Ashtamudy estuary and various anthropogenic activities such as boating, civic effluents, and fishing. Upstream sites showed good water quality conditions and caddisfly abundance. The Kallada River is under threat of anthropogenic\ndisturbances, especially in the mid and downstream sections. The caddisfly assemblage proved to be suitable in identifying variations in water quality conditions in the Kallada River because of their significant responses to environmental fluctuations."

    "abstract": "Background: The advent of Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART) does influence the overall oral health care of children. The children undergoing HAART have shown an increase in caries activity owing to sugars in medicines to make them more palatable. \n\nAim: The aim of the study was to assess and compare the Oral Health of Children Living with HIV/AIDS (CLHAs) and Adolescents Living with HIV/AIDS (ALHAs) undergoing HAART and those who are HAART-naïve. \n\nMethods: This study was carried out at different Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO's) across Kerala, India. The study group consisted of 150 HIV-infected children aged 6–18 years. They were divided into two groups. Group 1 comprised of children prior to onset of HAART and Group 2 included children who had been on HAART for more than 3 years (HAART naïve). The assessment of dental caries status and dental plaque status was done. The observations were tabulated and statistically analyzed. \n\nResults: On Statistical Analysis, significant difference was noted between the groups with the Group 1(2.26 ± 0.58;p value = .000*) showing higher scores of dental plaque and a significant difference was also observed with respect to dental caries scores with DMFT and dmft scores higher in Group 2(dmft 2.08 ± 2.85; p value = .001* and DMFT 4.10 ± 1.71;p value = .003*). \n\nConclusion: It was concluded that oral hygiene conditions were poor in children with HIV, with dental plaque scores more in HAART-naïve which may be due to their lesser visits and reinforcements regarding oral hygiene from a dentist and dental caries score more in HAART group, this may be attributed to the hidden sugars present in HAART medications to make it more palatable. Early recognition and management of oral conditions are important to improve the quality of life for these children."

It draws from a novel conceptual framework that combines assemblage-thinking with theories of social contracts in disasters. \n\nThe article first explores how past development processes and contemporary migration policies in Kerala, and India more widely, generated conditions of vulnerability for migrant workers in Kerala prior to the pandemic. We then show that Government of Kerala interventions, in some cases supported by the central Government of India, temporarily addressed these vulnerabilities during the pandemic period. These efforts should be applauded. \n\nHowever, in acknowledging the helpful response of the Government of Kerala we problematise their stance on migrant workers during ‘normal’ times and speculate that permanently addressing these conditions of vulnerability would be a more logical approach. We acknowledge this involves overcoming many barriers which have their roots beyond the jurisdiction of the Government of Kerala. Thus, our paper also contains national-level policy implications for India."

    "abstract": "Woman's body has always been and continues to be one of the leitmotifs in cinema. In its objectified state, the female body caters to the creation of the erotic spectacle and contributes significantly to the commercial aspect of the cinematic medium. It has always been a salable and consumable commodity on the silver screen. As Mulvey puts it, woman embodies, plays to, and represents masculine desire in everything from pin-ups to striptease. The central motif of erotic spectacle is the woman presented as a sexual object. She plays the typical exhibitionist role of being observed and put on a show.\n\nEngaging with the existing literature in the area, one could easily identify the linearity of hitherto discussions on the cinematic representation of the female body. Most of the deliberations have been concerned with the \"sexual,\" taking in the questions of sexual objectification and the infringement of women's corporeal desires. Habeeb observes that all the women who appeared on screen were one-dimensional and had the defined purpose of pleasing the masculine observer; Khalsa states that cinemas depict women as mere sex objects and devalue their sexuality. \n\nThe originality of the study develops in this context and the researchers attempt to discuss the \"non-sexual\" representation of the female body, in relation to the new-generation Malayalam movies <i>The Great Indian Kitchen</i> (2021), <i>Freedom Fight</i> (2022), and <i>Jaya Jaya Jaya Jaya Hey</i> (2022). The paper argues that the new-generation Malayalam cinema foregrounds the empowered female self. The empowerment achieved by the female self is an arduous and embattled journey in search of autonomy of the body, spatial mobility, and a violence-free environment, represented by the concept of bodily integrity."

    "abstract": "Background This study identified the risk factors for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection among household contacts of index patients and determined the incubation period (IP), serial interval, and estimates of secondary infection rate in Kerala, India. Methods We conducted a cohort study in three districts of Kerala among the inhabitants of households of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction-positive coronavirus disease 2019 patients between January and July 2021. About 147 index patients and 362 household contacts were followed up for 28 days to determine reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction positivity and the presence of total antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 on days 1, 7, 14, and 28. Results The mean IP, serial interval, and generation time were 1.6, 3, and 3.9 days, respectively. The secondary infection rate at 14 days was 43.0%. According to multivariable regression analysis persons who worked outside the home were protected (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.24–0.85), whereas those who had kissed the coronavirus disease 2019-positive patients during illness were more than twice at risk of infection (aOR, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.01–5.2) than those who had not kissed the patients. Sharing a toilet with the index patient increased the risk by more than twice (aOR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.42–4.64) than not sharing a toilet. However, the contacts who reported using masks (aOR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.4–4.4) were at a higher risk of infection in household settings. Conclusions Household settings have a high secondary infection rate and the changing transmissibility dynamics such as IP, serial interval should be considered in the prevention and control of SARS-CoV-2."

In so doing, the study tries to unravel how <i>Kumbalangi Nights</i> effectuates a deconstruction of the customary nexus of darkness/night with unfamiliarity, malevolence, jeopardy, and ethical degradation, interposing an innovative paradigm wherein darkness/night emerges as a corporeal and psychically emancipatory counterfoil to the panoptic scrutiny of the hegemonic forces and their surveillant consciousness.\n\nSimultaneously, the research enumerates the visual semiotics of nocturnal motifs in the film, capturing the latent aesthetics of darkness and its subliminal constituents, which transgress normative epistemologies of darkness/night as vacuity or ineffability. While doing that, the study also discerns the historical mutability of darkness/night within Malayalm cinema, tracing its metamorphic trajectory and evolving interplay with these thematic motifs across temporal epochs."

Specifically, issues with salary payment and reduced working hours make re-migration less likely. We then apply a two-stage multinomial regression to identify the causes of these negative experiences and how they shape a migrant's future decisions. \n\nWe conclude that such experiences discourage re-migration and increase the preference to work in the country of origin. Our research offers insights for shaping future migration policies in the region."

    "abstract": "The Indian state of Kerala has invoked much attention within development and gender debates, specifically in relation to its female capital-an outcome of interrelated historical, cultural and social practices. \n\nOn the one hand, Kerala has been romanticised, with its citizenry, particularly women, being free of social divisions and uplifted through educational well-being. On the other hand, its realism is stark, particularly in the light of recent social changes.\n\nUsing a Bourdieusian frame of analysis, Development and Gender Capital in India explores the forces of globalisation and how they are embedded within power structures. Through narratives of women’s lived experiences in the private and public domains, it highlights the 'anomie of gender' through complexities and contradictions vis-à-vis processes of modernity, development and globalisation. \n\nBy demonstrating the limits placed upon gender capital by structures of patriarchy and domination, it argues that discussions about the empowered Malayalee women should move from a mere 'politics of rhetoric and representation' to a more embedded 'politics of transformation', meaningfully taking into account women’s changing roles and identities."

The strongest drivers of CH4 dynamics in different anthropogenically impacted zones were traced. The source of organic matter for CH4 production was revealed to be terrestrial C3 plants, autochthonous production, marine phytoplankton, and sewage inputs. \n\nThe study suggests that monsoonal urbanised tropical estuaries may be an important but under-recognised element of the global CH4 budget."

    "abstract": "Microalgae-derived biodiesel has emerged as a promising solution to meet the increasing global demand for carbon-free and environmentally sustainable energy. \n\nThis study explores the diversity of microalgae across seasons in Kerala, India, to assess their potential for biodiesel production. \n\nA total of 90 marine microalgal isolates were analysed, revealing Cyanophyceae sp. as the dominant group (67.64%), followed by Bacillariophyceae (22.54%), Chlorophyceae (5.88%), Xanthophyceae (1.96%), and Trebouxiophyceae (1.96%). Microalgae species distribution varied across regions, with Munnakal region exhibiting the highest diversity. \n\nSeasonal fluctuations played a significant role, with diversity peaking during pre-monsoon, followed by post-monsoon, summer, and winter. Five isolates with the highest growth (OD values) were identified, and SNMVBTAR007 (285 ± 1.5 mg/L) and SNMVBTAR001 (294 ± 2.0 mg/L) displayed the highest biomass concentration. Lipid analysis revealed SNMVBTAR001 (59%) and SNMVBTAR044 (55%) as having the highest lipid concentrations. Molecular characterisation confirmed their identification as Nodosilinea nodulosa. Transesterification of extracted microalgal lipids yielded biodiesel meeting ASTM and EN standards. Fatty acid analysis indicated the presence of desirable fatty acids, particularly oleic acid. Qualitative assessments, including density, acid value, flashpoint, and soap content, aligned with biodiesel standards. Nodosilinea nodulosa SNMVBTAR001, a potential candidate for biodiesel production, with maximum efficiency of 23.10 km/L in an electrical generator. \n\nThis study underscores the promise of Nodosilinea nodulosa microalgae for sustainable biodiesel production, offering eco-friendly energy solutions and reduced carbon emissions. Further research is needed to optimise cultivation and production techniques for large-scale biodiesel production, contributing to a greener and more sustainable energy future."

    "abstract": "Fragile wetland habitats are susceptible to multiple threats from anthropogenic activities. Direct waste deposition, habitat modification and overexploitation of fish have caused alternations in food webs in wetlands. Kingfishers are ecological indicators with the potential ability to respond to the minute changes in their microenvironment. Their abundance and distribution at wetland habitats are affected by multiple environmental factors. \n\nWe studied the kingfisher assemblages in India to determine proximate and ultimate causes of their decline. We recorded the abundance of five species of kingfishers across five wetland habitats from 2011 to 2020 in Kerala, southwest coast of India. \n\nKingfishers were counted twice in a month between 6.00 and 12.00 hrs. Air temperature, water temperature, humidity and turbidity were recorded. We measured fish diversity and abundance and organic waste as an additional explanatory variable. One-way ANOVA, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model and structural equation modelling were used to determine which explanatory variables affected kingfisher populations. \n\nAir temperature, water temperature and turbidity increased significantly during the study and had negative effects on the abundance of kingfishers. Humidity decreased significantly but had no effect on the kingfisher abundance. Fish abundance declined and had a strong positive effect on the abundance of kingfishers. The analysis of incidence of wastes across the study areas revealed that, all the sites were severely polluted. We also observed drastic decline in the abundance of all the species of kingfishers studied across the sites with a rapid decline in Pied Kingfisher and slower decline in White-throated Kingfisher. Black-capped Kingfisher is a local migrant to the study areas and is already red listed and categorized as Vulnerable (VU). \n\nThis study suggests that kingfisher assemblages are declining along with the health status of the habitat. Urgent action is needed to help in designing and implementing effective management strategies for the sustainability of wetlands in the region."

    "abstract": "Varietal identification of economically significant crops has acquired great importance in the global market especially in the terms of protection of plant varieties. Kerala is the home to several different specialty traditional rice varieties which is vital sources of nutritional and therapeutic properties. Traditional rice landraces are an integral part of the nutrition, medicine, and culture of Kerala. Most of these varieties possess similar morphological characteristics but differ in their nutritional and medicinal properties. It has become a challenge for a non-taxonomist to identify and recognise the traditional rice varieties accurately. DNA barcoding has been considered a standard method to identify species or variety which utilises a unique pattern of variation in the DNA of the species. It can be adopted as a routine and faster approach to determine the molecular taxonomy when compared to morphological identification approaches. \n\nCurrently, the most intensively applied two DNA barcode loci are maturase K (matK) and ribulose 1,5-biphosphate carboxylase (rbcL) for plant identification. But, the efficacy of these two loci in discriminating plant species may vary. Hence, in this study fifty-four traditional rice varieties collected from the Wayanad district of Kerala were used to generate and compare the two standard DNA barcode regions for plant matK and rbcL via PCR amplification. \n\nThe varieties collected were varying in the husk color from black; red to brown and the brown rice varieties not display any morphological variation. \n\nThe study identified that among the two selected markers rbcL was observed to have the potential to discriminate the intra and interspecific regions of the studied rice varieties and this would have been utilised to generate DNA barcodes for each variety. \n\nThis study separates and identifies 28 traditional rice varieties among the 54 studied varieties as Oryza nivara, the wild progenitor of Asian cultivated rice. Along with other supporting information the data presented here could be used as a reference to check the authenticity and varietal purity of commercially significant rice varieties in the future."

    "abstract": "The book is about the origins and functioning of perhaps one of the largest associational networks of women from poorer households in the world. What is interesting to note is the decentralised nature of the functioning of this network at the village and township levels. \n\nApart from these decentralised groups, there is a state-financed and administered hand-holding agency in the form of a Poverty Alleviation Mission created by the Government of Kerala. These together form what the authors call the Kudumbashree System. \n\nWhile appreciating the creation and functioning of the Kudumbashree Mission, the authors critically evaluate its contribution and find several shortcomings that together constitute what a few other scholars have called 'governmentality' of the Mission's work that now dominates the functioning of the women's groups at the ground level. \n\nWhile the economic benefits arising out of the Kudumbashree System's functioning have been quite limited, what have been striking are the achievements in personal dignity, individual, and collective capability in dealing with institutions of governance, especially at the local level, and a measure of social recognition and dignity that were eluding the poor women for so long. \n\nFurther transformative potential is considerable, but that calls for a genuine change in the structure of governance from bureaucratic domination to participatory decision-making.  \n\nThe study has put forward a number of policy recommendations that could strengthen the path towards economic emancipation and the ending of absolute forms of poverty of a multidimensional kind."

Substantial research shows a robust, dose–response relationship between ACEs and subsequent adverse outcomes. \n\nThe current study examines the prevalence of ACEs, family risk factors, and Behavioural Health Problems (BHPs) and, the risk of BHPs in relation to family risk factors while considering the influential role of ACEs. \n\nA Demographic proforma and Childhood Experiences of Care and Abuse Questionnaire-2 were used to gather data from 613 youth, selected through multi-stage stratified sampling from selected educational institutions in Kerala, South India. Descriptive and inferential statistics (Chi-square test and Binary Logistic regression) were used for analysis. \n\nKeralite youth have exposure to multiple ACEs and family risk factors. Various ACEs were highly prevalent (14%-69%) and a quarter of youth had four or more ACEs, with more exposure in males. Neglect, antipathy, and psychological abuse were the common types. Family risk factors, domestic violence (8%), and parental substance abuse (10%) were significant predictors for loss, antipathy and sexual abuse, and the ACEs score. Youth with family risk factors were more likely to have ACEs and those with ACEs exposure were more likely to have BHPs. Parental substance abuse increased the likelihood of depression irrespective of ACEs exposure. \n\nThis evidence suggests that the exposure to family risk factors and ACEs increases the likelihood of the risk of BHPs in youth and their interrelatedness needs to be addressed in preventing the negative outcomes in later life."

Though proselytisation was accelerated by egalitarian and emancipatory ideologies, it became a shift from one oppressive, exploitative social fabric to another hegemonic structure composed of institutionalised religion underlined by casteist ideologies. \n\nChristianity in Kerala turned out to be Brahminical and catered to the interest of upper-caste Christians. Despite its egalitarian claims, discrimination unabashedly pervaded the churches of Kerala. Dalit liberation movements in the 20th century heralded by both the Dalit and Dalit Christian leaders profoundly influenced the public life of Kerala and brought a new paradigm to the slave castes. Such changes were reflected in the literary articulations of the period also. \n\nThis article examines how the Dalit Christian discourse is inaugurated in Malayalam novels as the result of the Dalit Christian liberation movements in the 20th century. By employing textual analysis as the research methodology and intersectionality as a theoretical lens, this article analyses Paul Chirakkarode’s <i>Pulayathara</i> (1962) and examines how the Dalit Christian liberation movement in the 20th century is instrumental in shaping an alternative epistemology and Dalit Christian identity."

It fared much better than the national average and other large states. It became the top Indian state with lower fertility rates and higher life expectancy at birth, resulting in a demographic shift where the relative size of the older people increased, and the young and working-age population decreased. This population ageing, a problematic phenomenon in the world’s advanced economies, will hurt Kerala and negatively affect its socio-economic status in the near future. One of the solutions lies in empowering the youth through a holistic and tailor-made youth policy.

    "abstract": "This article analyses the disputes over riverine islands between two princely states in colonial southern India in the 19th and early 20th centuries. These disputes arose because of changes in the islands’ landmass caused by water movements. Such tidal temporalities challenged cartographic rigidities and the established notions of sovereignty of states. \n\nWhat were assumed to be sovereign, undisputed, and infallible were unsettled by such hydrological power and the fluid ecologies involved. A set of challenges emanated from external concepts arising from colonialism which undermined the native geographical understanding of the land-water continuum due to the monetisation of land. \n\nThis article makes a critical appraisal of this double challenge to the traditional understanding of fluid ecologies while also highlighting the counter challenges from the princely states. These contests were particularly pronounced as the princely states had considerable autonomy in internal matters of administration and thus differed from the rest of the colonial territory directly ruled by the British in India. \n\nThe article contributes to the study of riverine islands by investigating the nature and fluidity of shifting islands, whose variation in temporal contexts has been barely acknowledged in Island Studies to date."

The concentration of chlorpyrifos (2.05–720.27 mg/kg) was the highest level reported from any agroecosystem in India. Community health risk assessment indicates high carcinogenic risk and greater susceptibility in children.

    "abstract": "With humans, animals and the environment being as interconnected as they are, the science describing their interactions needs to cut across disciplinary boundaries. Systems research at the interface between the three goes by several names, such as ‘Eco-Health’ and ‘Planetary Health’, each with a varied focus, but the concept of ‘One Health’ (OH) has stood out as the most popular one. COVID-19 has reiterated the importance of OH in response to health challenges. \n\nThis review aimed to assess the OH approach integration and implementation level in Kerala state, India, in the context of emerging zoonotic diseases. A systematic literature review was conducted by searching for relevant articles with specific keywords across six electronic databases. This involved screening the initial hits for titles and abstracts, then systematic sorting to identify the ones that met the criteria, followed by more thorough scrutiny to finally shortlist the six studies to be included in the review. \n\nWe found that OH in Kerala has made good progress, as evident from a few recent examples, but has a long way to go with significant challenges. In line with the study's aim, identifying and analysing what is already done, what is missing and what needs to be done can have wider implications for future OH implementation. Relevant threats and opportunities were identified, with lessons for Kerala and India and broader applications."

    "abstract": "The Western Ghats in the humid tropical zone of Kerala State, India have several drinking water, irrigation and hydroelectric projects, which exclusively depend on streamflow. The seasonal monsoon rainfall imposes several limitations in estimating the streamflows. The rugged topography of these highland areas with thick forest vegetation restricts the installation of conventional gauging stations. \n\nConsidering these factors, an attempt is made to estimate the streamflow from these watersheds using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool model. Eight representative watersheds with stream gauging stations were selected, of which six were used for initial calibration, validation of the model and identifying the model parameters to be regionalised. The regionalised model was then applied to the other two watersheds, and the estimated data were compared with the observed. Global average, regression method and common parameter transfer approaches were adopted to regionalise the parameters. The calibrated model parameters are averaged in the global average method. The regression function in the data analysis add-on in the Excel platform determined the functional relationship between the watershed characteristics and the model calibration parameters. The parameter transfer helped recognise two standard sensitive parameters. \n\nIt is found that by providing the topography, land use and soil data, the streamflow from the ungauged watersheds of the highland belt in the wet humid tropical zone of Kerala can be satisfactorily simulated."

It examines the interplay between local and transnational influences, including caste structures, historical social reform movements, and pressures of upward mobility, that have shaped the religious landscape of Syrian Christians in Kerala. \n\nThe research points out that the transnational migratory context has induced a shift in the doctrinal orientation among Syrian Christians. Syrian Christians increasingly lean towards a theological doctrine that blends materialistic values and spirituality. The study observes the complex interaction encompassing socio-cultural and economic variables with reference to Syrian Christianity in context of transnational migration. \n\nThis research contributes to a deeper understanding of evolution and religious development within Syrian Christianity, offering insights into the broader discourse on the interplay of religion, migration, and cultural change. \n\nThis study highlights the need for a broader framework to trace the processes covering transnational religious connections and migration-influenced religious change, beyond the optic of mere economic and social remittances."

    "abstract": "Although the ecological and economic services rendered by the wetland ecosystems are innumerable, the exposure of inhabitants to hazardous climatic events is on the rise. For instance, the Kuttanad wetland ecosystem in Kerala, India, faces uneven rainfall patterns, leading to recurrent flooding. The present study examines people's vulnerability to elevated flooding risk in the region, factors responsible for migration in the wake of climate change and their adaptive capacity to such events. \n\nThe primary survey-based study follows the theoretical framework of vulnerability and adaptive capacity. Physical asset loss, sinking houses, elevated health risks and loss of livelihood are factors identified for increased vulnerability to flood risks. The exacerbating vulnerability translates into the mass migration of local inhabitants. \n\nThe Probit regression underscores the role of households' socio-economic background in migrating from the region, seeking safe havens. Marginalised social groups and people reliant on the local environment are most vulnerable. As per the study, the absence of pre and post-flood measures affects the adaptive capacity of the inhabitants. Given the gravity of flooding risk, the study suggests channelised policy measures that are quintessential to improve their resilience and adaptive capacity."

    "abstract": "This paper explores the shifting and contemporary manifestations of menstrual taboos in central Kerala, India, particularly through the evocation of zoomorphic language and symbolism. It specifically focuses on a seemingly commonplace metaphor, <i>pattiyayi</i> (has become a dog), and argues that its connotative and cultural meanings have negative consequences for the construction of gender in Keralan society. \n\nThe metaphor likens a menstruating woman to a dog. Further correlations between dogs and rabies patients culturally place the three categories – the domesticated carnivore, the person with a stigmatised illness, and the menstruating woman – as liminal entities, equivalent by association. \n\nAdditionally, examining dog idioms (<i>patti</i>) in Kottayam that refer to the Dalit castes, the paper elucidates how idiomatic expressions evince societal juxtapositions of menstruating women with socially disparaged castes. These allegorical concurrences also draw attention to how the body and its organic activities and the propensity of certain bodies to incur permanent and internal pollution are at the root of symbolic denigration and gender and caste hierarchies. \n\nFurthermore, through the Foucauldian perspective on language, the paper links the dog metaphor to a micro theory of power by signifying the role of gendered power relations and the coalescence of discursive and material processes in historically shaping it."

    "abstract": "This chapter considers phenomena that have been called recursive within morphology. These include cyclic and interleaved application of morphology and phonology, nested morphosyntactic structures, the (non-)reorderability of affixes and apparent prosodic recursion at the (sub-)word level. The predictions that existing models make about recursive morphological structures are considered and the chapter examines whether those predictions hold across languages. Case studies from a variety of typologically distinct languages are examined, including Malayalam (Dravidian), Adyghe (Northwest Caucasian), Dakota (Siouan), Zezuru Shona and Chichewa (Bantu), Kaqchikel (Mayan) and English. Ultimately, it is found that morphological recursion tends to align with, but is more restricted than, syntactic recursion. Phonological and semantic constraints tend to limit the kinds of morphological recursion seen across languages."

    "abstract": "Medical anthropologists have not paid enough attention to the variation at the level of the individual practitioners of biomedicine, and anthropological critiques of biomedical psychiatry as it is practiced in settings outside the Global North have tended to depict psychiatrists in monolithic terms. In this article, we attempt to demonstrate that, at least in the case of India, some psychiatrists perceive limitations in the biomedical model and the cultural assumptions behind biomedical practices and ideologies. This paper focuses on three practitioners who supplement their own practices with local and alternative healing modalities derived from South Asian psychologies, philosophies, systems of medicine and religious and ritual practices. The diverging psychiatric practices in this paper represent a rough continuum. They range from a bold and confident psychiatrist who uses various techniques including ritual healing to another who yearns to incorporate more Indian philosophy and psychology in psychiatric practice and encourages students of ayurvedic medicine to more fully embrace the science they are learning to a less proactive psychiatrist who does not describe a desire to change his practice but who is respectful and accepting of ayurvedic treatments that some patients also undergo. Rather than simply applying a hegemonic biomedical psychiatry, these psychiatrists offer the possibility of a more locally-attuned, context sensitive psychiatric practice."

    "abstract": "Human desire to attain the state of being well has existed since the beginning of man’s social life. Within and across cultures, people conceptualise well-being differently because of its multidimensional nature. Even though the perspective towards well-being is totally relative, it is basically connected with one’s attitude towards quality of life and life circumstances. \n\nAmong the women in fisherfolk, decrease in marine resources, institutional changes, occupational diversification, and the role of Kudumbasree initiatives have created significant changes in attitudes towards being well. \n\nThis anthropological research analyses the mediating effect of three socio-cultural domains such as life experience, attitude, and life satisfaction on different aspects of subjective well-being. Three hundred and ten women from the marine fisherfolk families in Kozhikode District of Kerala participated in the study. \n\nThe structural equation modelling proposed in the study revealed the significant influence of above three domains on subjective well-being with the support of thirteen sub domains including health and hunger. The model also reflects the signifiers relevant to the life satisfaction of women in a particular socio-cultural, economic, and environmental setting. \n\nThe findings of the study have ethical and applied implications, if subjective dimensions of well-being are considered in the preparation of public policies for women and thereby attaining a life circumstance where there is zero hunger."

It examines the profound impact of this erosion on the community's leisure activities, particularly their beloved pastime of football. It also analyses the local government's proposed strategy of managed retreat, which involves relocating vulnerable communities away from threatened areas. It considers its limitations in light of the fisherfolk's deep emotional and cultural connections with their lands and non-material culture.

Within colonial modernity, the literate Malayali child was invaluable for the newspaper for mediating visions of a utopic, secular, and non-hierarchical Malayali society; thereby establishing itself as an agent of modernity. \n\nIn contemporary times, the newspapers address of children have been oriented toward helping families and schools tackle the excesses of modernity, such as the putative dangers associated with children’s unregulated use of internet-based media. Mediated stories of such dystopic childhoods provide newspapers a rich soil for re-imagining childhood in ways that resolve the paradox of modernity. \n\nWhile utopic childhoods envisioned by newspaper initiatives like <i>Nalla Paadam</i> (Good Lessons) seem to be a critique of middle-class parenting gone awry, I show that these initiatives garner political and public consensus because they dovetail with middle-class aspirations."

    "abstract": "The paper explores the fragmented discourses in the Indian digital public sphere in a post-truth world. The normative concept of the public sphere by Jürgen Habermas has been brought under critical scrutiny in the era of emotional communication online. The digital world opened democratic and inclusive spaces that are desirable for a picture-perfect public sphere as imagined by Habermas. The low entry barriers and inclusivity of the digital public sphere changed the patterns of political communication worldwide. However, such a change is not an isolated event and must be located within the historical context of a changing political environment. Contemporary society has entered the post-truth era where opinionated, emotional outbursts downplay objective reality. \n\nThe paper explores explicitly the public comments recorded under an infotainment video on the YouTube platform of a private channel in Kerala, the southernmost state of India. A case study method was adopted to analyse the theme, subtext, and visible structure of the discourse in the digital public sphere, which is a subset of the larger public sphere. Disconcertingly, the findings revealed fragmented discourses in a public sphere, characterised by unidimensional historical narratives, fallacious arguments, political apathy, and emotional or romanticised appeals, all of which are classic symptoms of a post-truth era."

After discussing the trends of urbanisation in both the states, we present a case study of one city in Tamil Nadu, namely Salem. \n\nWhile there is no doubt that the urban development process in Tamil Nadu is even, dispersed and balanced, the problems in cities such as Salem are more or less in accordance with the problems we found in other cities such as Dharwad. Urban governance also did not show much difference between that of cities such as Dharwad as the cities were basically governed by bureaucracy."

The Pattani cult (of the deity) is said to have been brought to Sri Lanka by Gajabahu."

    "abstract": "In Kerala, South India, individual pursuits of nature cure (<i>prakriti chikitsa</i>) invoke ethical narratives about an idealised purer past, contrasting a dangerous present saturated with social and environmental toxins. While first popularised in India by M. K. Gandhi, nature cure has gained contemporary fame as a low-cost intervention for Kerala’s purported health crisis: chronic lifestyle diseases. Nonprofessionalised natural healers identify as public health activists, teaching predominantly urban, middle-class patients how to revive local lifeways of self-doctorhood. \n\nThis article narrates how two ageing patients internalise their naturopathic doctors’ advice to detoxify and ‘do nothing’ rather than strive for biomedical cure. By naturally revitalising their bodies, they cultivate feelings of intense independence and ecological attachment that reconfigure experiences of migrated-kin isolation. \n\nIn counterpoint to literature that frames biopolitical and medical discourses as causally producing moral subjectivities, this article demonstrates how persons agentively craft counternormative, vitalistic models of ageing and health, contributing to broader localist imaginaries of reviving pre-toxic lifeways."

    "abstract": "The study attempts to understand the contribution of international tourism on economic growth at a sub-national level (i.e. for Kerala) of the Indian economy. By exercising Johansen cointegration test and Vector Error Correction Model on the annual data from 1980 to 2017, it reveals the existence of a positive long-run association between tourism and economic growth. It finds that an increase of Foreign Tourist Arrivals (FTA) by 1% leads to almost a same percentage increase in Gross State Domestic Product (by 0.97%) in the long-run. Thus, it suggests that tourism has a significant potential of unleashing the economic growth of Kerala and this is found to be robust with the use of alternative econometric estimation methods."

    "abstract": "This volume presents a systematic and fresh interpretation of a mid-second-century AD papyrus - the so-called Muziris papyrus - which preserves on its two sides fragments of a unique pair of documents: on one side, a loan agreement to finance a commercial enterprise to South India and, on the other, an assessment of the fiscal value of a South Indian cargo imported on a ship named the Hermapollon. \n\nThe two texts, whose informative potential has long been underexploited, clarify several aspects of the early Roman Empire's trade with South India, including transport logistics, financial and legal elements in the loan agreement funding the commercial enterprise, the trade goods included in the South Indian cargo, and the technicalities of calculating and collecting Roman customs duties on the Indian imports. \n\nThis study also considers imperial fiscal policy as it related to the South Indian trade, the overall evolution of Rome's trade relations with South India, the structure and organization of South Indian trade stakeholders, and the role played by private tax-collectors. \n\nThe in-depth analysis sheds new light on this important sector of the Roman economy during the first two centuries AD in two innovative ways: through a balanced consideration of South Indian sources and data, and by drawing comparisons with the pepper trade from late antiquity, the Middle Ages, and early modernity, resulting in a longue durée perspective on the western trade in South Indian pepper."

Kerala Muslims are one of the largest Muslim communities in India, and a majority are the descendants of Arab traders and local women, or of local converts known as Mappilas.\n\nThis article relates the reformist agenda in the writings of Sayyid Sana'ullah Makti Tannal (1847-1912), who argued for a reinterpretation of Islamic principle based on scriptural purity and return to pristine Islam. Makti Tannal believed direct access to, and proper understanding of, the Quran and the Hadith would distance Muslims from accretions to Islam that he thought of as impure. Invoking the distinction of ‘haramand halal’ as the cornerstone of Islamic law, he argued against the legitimacy of un-Islamic elements of popular Islam.\n\nThese efforts took place in late nineteenth-century Kerala, and had a huge impact on the socio-religious landscape, particularly on the inevitability and imminence of Islamic reform in the colonial era. Furthermore, this paper highlights how Makti advocated textually defined Islamic codes of practice to safeguard ‘Muslimness’ and shape a new vision of a moral community for Malayali Muslims."

    "abstract": "This chapter studies the strategic political origins of gender-equalizing land inheritance reforms using legislative debates newly translated to English, and analysis of historical behaviour and motivations. It examines three states and the constitutional amendment mandating women’s electoral representation. \n\nKerala entered independence with one of the highest levels of caste and landholding inequality, alongside small matrilineal communities with high female autonomy. Here, women’s rights to land were weaponised as a source of injustice (to men). \n\nAndhra Pradesh also entered independence with high caste and landholding inequality, absent a strong tradition of women’s autonomy. Activism by radical, caste-based movements to undercut caste dominance enabled rethinking of power elsewhere. In this ‘moderate’ example of reform, legislation was symbolic, resonant with newly pivotal female voters but unlikely to be enforced. \n\nIn Karnataka, moderate caste and landholding inequality enabled a newly empowered party and chief minister to legislate and enforce reform for women, due to women's status as pivotal voters and the promise of fundamentally restructuring political agency. Constitutional reform occurred due to women’s increasingly pivotal role as well-informed voters willing to reward or punish parties for their commitments."

Through the strategic use of ‘ecospatiality’, it is shown that the ‘state–society synergy’ does exist in its potentiality, although, by and large, it is ignored in already existing ‘riskscape’ scholarship. However, the context of this study proves to be an ideal site for illustrating the possibilities of actualising this latent potential through ecospatiality planning. Such attempts can, at the same time, be of local effectiveness and global significance."

Small groups started evolving, centred on maestros of art who had social and financial influence. This slowly paved the path towards institutionalization, wherein small troupes were adopted by societies formed by influential organizers and connoisseurs. As a result of institutionalization, the authority of classical arts became vested with those who were easily influenced by commodification and mass culture. Besides the history of the art of six centuries, as well as its present existence under institutionalization, Achuthankutty elaborates the aforementioned points objectively with evidence gained by interviewing masters and collecting literature."

Utilizing epigraphic, architectural and textual sources on a few such personalities from Malabar and Bengal, I take a preliminary step towards debunking the exclusive association of Africans in South Asia with slavery and military labour. These historical figures are not anomalies rather they are representatives of a larger intellectual, legal, and religious network that fared between Asia and Africa. Although they are evident in historical sources, they have been systematically forgotten in contemporary memories and scholarship while this forgetfulness befits the prevalent stereotyping tendencies of Africa and Africans in South Asia."

    "abstract": "In the literature on development studies, the state of Kerala in India is known for its high human and social development despite its low-income status. However, there has been a turnaround in its growth performance and has now come to occupy a high rank in terms of per capita income among Indian States. This has been largely through a high growth performance facilitated by significant remittances from abroad. However, there have not been consistent time-series data on annual remittances. \n\nThis paper is an attempt to fulfil this gap by estimating foreign remittances to Kerala for a period of 47 years that is close to half a century. Using these data, the paper has presented a Modified State Income for Kerala and calculated its impact on consumption and savings. The significance of the sizeable emigration to the labour market situation has also been highlighted. Given the fact that remittances come as household income confined to a small segment of the total households, the impact of annual remittances on income and consumption inequality has also been highlighted. \n\nThe results show an increasing trend in inequality. Despite a high growth performance aided by remittances, Kerala has not been able to address its longstanding problem of educated unemployment, especially for its women. In this context, the state’s inability to take advantage of the enhanced per capita income to maintain its tax–income ratio, let alone enhance it, assumes great significance as an area of concern."

    "abstract": "An estimated 3.5 million interstate migrant workers have become an indispensable part of Kerala’s economy. The state also offers the highest wages for migrant workers for jobs in the unorganised sector in the entire Indian subcontinent. Further, the state has evolved several measures for the inclusion of the workers and was able to effectively respond to their distress during the national lockdown. This paper examines labour migration to Kerala, key measures by the government to promote the social security of the workers and the state’s response to the distress of migrant workers during lockdown, by synthesising the available secondary evidence. The welfare measures as well as interventions initiated by the state are exemplary and promising given the intent and provisions. However, some of them do not appear to have consideration of the grassroots requirements and implementation mechanisms to enhance access. As a result, the policy intent and substantial investments have not yielded the expected results. The state’s effective response to the distress of workers during the lockdown emanates from its overall disaster preparedness and resilience achieved from confronting with two consecutive state-wide natural disasters and a public health emergency in the immediate past. While the government has played a strategic role through policy imperative and ensuring a synergistic response, the data presented by the state indicate a much larger but invisible role played by the employers and civil society in providing food and shelter to workers."

How are forms of identity evoked within broader social relations in a migrant context? This article explores these questions by looking at how the Tamil Dalit tea workers in the South Indian state of Kerala experience the stigmatisation of their identity categories in the context of two significant events that occurred in the tea belt—an economic crisis and a conflict between two states over managing a dam. The way ‘migrant’ workers are categorised in their ‘host’ society is discussed here as fundamental to how they experience life both in and out of their workplaces. Extending Philippe Bourgois's notion of conjugated oppression, I argue that when dominant groups stigmatise, evoke and employ certain aspects of the workers' identities to their disadvantage, they are engaging in a phenomenon that I call ‘categorical oppression’."

Despite its underwhelming healthcare infrastructure, Kasaragod district managed to contain the transmission and record a 100 per cent recovery rate, indicating a promising model of infection control. However, the district subsequently succumbed to community-level transmission when another wave of positive cases of COVID-19 was detected among repatriated overseas citizens on 7 May 2020. \n\nThe article explores the confluence of elements that allowed the initial successful recovery from a second stage transmission and then examines the factors that later led to community-level transmission.

It examines the implementation of the Indian Factories Act and its subsequent impact on Malabar’s beedi industry during 1937–1941, focusing on the interaction between state, capital and labour within the framework of British India’s labour-legal history. \n\nDespite resistance from their workers, beedi manufacturers circumvented the provisions of the Factories Act by fragmenting the factory production space. Contrary to the intentions of the state and the workers, both the Act and the ensuing trade union agitations only served to promote the fragmentation of production units and exacerbate the exploitation of workers. The study argues that while union mobilisation raised the political consciousness of the beedi working class, it did not significantly improve wages or working conditions in the long term."

However, the conflicts that emerge in such a complex organisational field comprising multiple stakeholders with diverse interests remain under-examined. \n\nOur analysis of community-based palliative care in Kerala identifies four ‘logic conflicts’ that indicate competing frames of reference in an organisational field. These conflicts shape decision-making and coordination and manifest as: 1) professional versus community logics, 2) centralised versus decentralised governance logics, 3) generalist versus specialist care logics, 4) charity versus rights-based logics. \n\nWe also identify two mechanisms – forming coalitions and fostering plurality – by which actors manage these conflicting logics. We discuss contributions to public health palliative care conversations and implications for nurturing and sustaining care communities."

    "abstract": "What makes the chapters on Monsoon Asia unique is the analysis of the Dutch Empire from the point of view of Asian societies. First of all, it is stressed that, from a global point of view, the rise of the Dutch seaborne empire is part of a much wider and earlier coastal turn, which in Asia has been described as an Age of Commerce. It is not only European, but also Chinese and Islamic, expansion that characterises this phase of increasing maritime globalisation. Those Eurasian empires that continued to exploit the nomadic horsepower of the Eurasian Arid Zone were soon able to incorporate this maritime dynamic. In these empires, the Dutch retained a marginal presence as meek merchants subject to the whims of indigenous brokers and local governments. In other, more tropical parts of Asia, the aggressive operations of the Dutch prevented indigenous states such as Mataram and Kandy from incorporating the booming coastal regions of Java and Ceylon, respectively. In these insular areas, the Dutch were able to create territorial power and impose their monopoly on the production and sale of cloves, nutmeg, mace and cinnamon. In Maluku we can even speak of a Dutch ‘heart of darkness’ as much of its population was decimated, to be replaced by colonists and slaves. In almost all cases, the Dutch could sustain territorial power only with the help of overseas Chinese communities which offered both a vital urban middle class (primarily in the Dutch colonial headquarters of Batavia) and access to extensive commercial networks. So far completely ignored is the case of Ceylon. In this early-modern laboratory of colonial rule, the reformist policies of enlightened Dutch governors had a deep impact on the local society through mapping, law and education. One of the first revolutionaries in the late eighteenth-century Netherlands was a Tamil intellectual raised in Dutch schools in Ceylon."

    "abstract": "The Indian Ocean is a region rich in its diversity of political mentalities. The era of Julius Nyerere, Ujamaa or Self-Reliance and African socialism was one such powerful realm of affect during the 1960s postcolonial period. Very little is written by Asian Tanzanian women about this critical period of African decoloniality, an experience fraught with new internationalism, the Bandung spirit and an Afro-Asian sensibility. This essay delves into the process of Africanization and the decolonial process through which new identities and emergent self-hoods appeared in postcolonial Tanzania. How did the Indian Ocean impact East African becoming during the early postcolonial era? What sorts of political imaginings unfolded at the junctures of race, culture, and citizenship during Tanzanian socialism. What did growing up under Ujamaa mean for Tanzanian Asians, and how did the struggle for African citizenship in Tanzania capture some of the deeper currents of the Indian Ocean shaping African futures? The essay is written as a travelogue remapping lost maps, forging new linkages between Cochin and Dar es salaam. It is an essay in somatic excavation addressing uneasy pasts whose political ferments impacted entire communities of immigrants, resulting in the first widely recorded forced migrations of Asians from Africa during the mid-twentieth century. This would be one significant Indian Ocean experience that would mark the dispersal of South Asians from East Africa across the globe."

    "abstract": "This article examines women directors in Malayalam cinema as historical subjects, looking at the manner in which they place themselves within Kerala’s cultural semiotics and its popular imaginary, disrupting or legitimising an illusion coded to the measure of gender desires and differences within its semiosphere. The logic of commercial cinema demands that women directors fall in sync with the representative politics of the male gaze and a capitalist libidinal economy, seducing women into passive codes of femininity and aligning men within the registers of a hegemonic masculinity, in effect foreclosing the play of alternative languages of desire. Malayalam cinema has had two kinds of women directors, one who tries to puncture this logic from within the male bastions of popular cinema, and the second who strives to be an ‘other’ to the mythmakers of the phallic order. The article attempts to read the first mode of intervention using the Marxian specular metaphor of the camera obscura as a hierarchical apparatus of ideological inversion where the real is substituted by a spectacle of the illusory. To analyse the latter, the article puts forward the metaphor of camera dentata – that modus of representation which seeks to topple the patriarchal and capitalist ideological predispositions of the cinematic apparatus, thus rendering it capable of diminishing the power of phallic signifiers and ‘the moral panics of sexuality’ they engender."

    "abstract": "Kerala, a small state in South India, has been celebrated as a development model by scholars across the world for its exemplary achievements in human development and poverty reduction despite relatively low GDP growth. It was no surprise, then, that the Covid 19 pandemic that hit Kerala before any other part of India, became a test case for the Kerala model in dealing with such a crisis. Kerala was lauded across the world once again as a success story in containing this unprecedented pandemic, in treating those infected, and in making needed provisions for those adversely affected by the lockdown. But as it turned out, this celebration was premature as Kerala soon faced a third wave of Covid 19 infections. The objective of this paper is to examine Kerala’s trajectory in achieving the success and then confronting the unanticipated reversal. It will examine the legacy of the Kerala model such as robust and decentralized institutions and provisions for healthcare, welfare and safety nets, and especially the capacity of a democratic state working in synergy with civil society and enjoying a high degree of consensus and public trust. It will then examine the new surge of the virus and attempts to establish if this was due to any mistakes made by the state or some deficits in its model of “public action” that includes adversarial politics having a disruptive tenor about it. We will conclude by arguing that the Kerala model is still relevant, and that it is still a model in motion."

    "abstract": "The Jews in India emigrated to Israel, centuries after their settlement in India, despite the cordial ambience provided in the land of their sojourn. The formation of Israel as a state and the altering socio-political scenario in India succeeding independence that augmented a sense of uncertainty regarding their future, culminated in the immigration to an unacquainted yet own home of their own. The long immigration process was traumatic to those caught between their homes, one unseen and the other experienced and lived, one inherited and the other gifted, posing many a troublesome question of identity, affiliation etc. Sethumadhavan’s Aliyah: The Last Jew in the Village, grounded on this historic event and narrated through the story of three generations of a Jewish family responding to the Zionist call, delves in to the emotional and philosophical underpinnings of the notions about nation, nationality, self, identity, affiliation, and a lot of other uncanvassed, unreciprocated questions."

The Emirates’ consequent economic setbacks, including a fear of the virus and falling job and financial security, threatened the survival of Indians – the largest expatriate demographic in the world and the Emirates. While apprehensive about their homeland’s ability to accommodate a mass reverse migrant population, the reverse migrants still retained attributes and values they associated with migration to the Emirates. Since the UAE hosts the largest number of Keralites in the world, the sample for this study comprises the first batch of Gulf-Malayalees, who had registered to return to Kerala. Through a means-end approach, this study reviews respondents’ attributes, consequences, and values at the time of migration and compares it with their perceptions during the sudden Covid-19 related reverse migration from the United Arab Emirates."

    "abstract": "African presence in the western Indian states of Gujarat and Kerala is remembered and revived by different subaltern communities through the palimpsestic spatial layering of sacred landscapes and geographies of death. In the city of Ahmedabad in Gujarat, there are several small mazars (shrines) dedicated to deceased African martyrs and saints. In addition to these small shrines, there are also a few mausoleums from the sixteenth century dedicated to African martyrs. On the other hand, in coastal Kochi in southern India, African memoryscapes survive through shrines dedicated to Kappiris (Africans) in Hindu sacred groves where benevolent African spirits continue to intercede in the lives of their devotees. While African cultural memories in the states of Gujarat and Kerala are fragmented, these dispersed and far-flung sacred edifices constructed to commemorate the lives of deceased Africans serve as active sites of memory. Employing ethnographic methodologies, I demonstrate how multiple narratives of African pasts are constructed by invested stakeholders through ritual transactions and memory-making practices at these spirited topographies in Kerala and Gujarat."

    "abstract": "This paper tries to understand waste as a technoscientific risk in Kerala in the context of late modernity. It also attempts to trace the eruption of waste as a subject of political discourse and as a problem that reveals the caste relations of Kerala Modernity€ The solid waste management controversy in Lalur, Thrissur is the case selected for analysis. The problem of waste is not a recent issue in Kerala and it has its roots going back to the nineteenth century. The colonial Paatta Kakkoose (dry latrine) system and the dumping yard for human excreta in Lalur are evidences for it. In the post-1990s, Kerala has witnessed a public outcry against the open dumping of waste and improper implementation of waste treatment plants and/or inappropriate selection of treatment technologies. The paper argues that the dalit community who has been managing the municipal solid waste in Lalur have a peculiar relationship with Kerala modernity."

Comparison between individual boats enables conclusions to be drawn about the builders’ conception, as well as variation within the type. The Keralite kettuvallams represent an ongoing vernacular tradition that is nevertheless poorly documented or preserved in museum contexts.

The attempt undertaken here is to close read the different narratives of the atrocities faced by the family of Chelakottethu Kunjuraman, who participated in the struggle, presented in the short story <i>Ave Maria</i> (2009) by K. R. Meera, the autobiographical account of the revolt by Thoppil Bhasi in <i>Olivile Ormakal</i> (1999) along with the 'Dedication' of his drama <i>Mooladhanam</i> (1979), and the narrative in the Communist Pany of India (Marxist)'s official website titled \"Legendary Past of Sooranadu\". These narratives will be read in the context of the efforts taken by the Patty to present itself as the torchbearer of the Renaissance values of equality in its interventions in the implementation of the Supreme Court's verdict on the Sabarimala case. Giving emphasis to the short story, the paper argues that Meera's story de-glorifies the narrative of the revolt by presenting the gendered experiences of women. The paper will try to understand how an important moment in the history of the communist movement in Kerala when retold in a literary space reveals the lacunae in the 'Kerala Renaissance' discourse from a gendered perspective which has been rekindled in contemporary times."

    "abstract": "This paper critically studies the manifestations of 'realism' propagated by Malayalam cinema during 1980s and '90s the period when ‘Kerala model of development’ became popular.\nThe modern obsession with reflexivity over sentimentality, and its employment in Malayalam cinema as 'middlebrow,' was also experimented in films that were made on cinema during this period. This is foregrounded in films such as <i>Lekhayude Maranam Oru Flashback</i> (The Death of Lekha: A Flashback, Dir K.G. George, 1983), an example of the middlebrow. Studies on metanarratives and reflexivity, just like how modemity affects people, largely focus on Brechtian 'alienation.' The paper, however, argues that Malayalam cinema produces 'double mystification' instead of alienation. Though this is executed through self-referentiality at the surface level, it reiterates realism as a hegemonic mode of production at the latent level. Thus, it is purposive realist aesthetics in middlebrow cinema that create the spectatorial Malayalee modern self. In other words, the cinema during this period makes middlebrow as the 'popular' by devising the figure of Malayalee citizen-spectator, who is made to distinguish oneself, from the 'mass-ified' other. The paper goes on to theorise that the 'real' within/of Malayalam cinema exorcises its own excess- sentimental melodrama, caste and sexuality - to the Tamil Other."

    "abstract": "The narrative of depression as a neurochemical imbalance in the brain or, more precisely, a deficiency of the neurotransmitters serotonin and norepinephrine – largely produced by commercial interests of the international and national pharmaceutical industry and spread globally by international diagnostic systems – has found its way into the offices of mainstream psychiatrists in Kerala. In the clinical encounters, social, economic and existential suffering is thus transformed into a medical condition, treatable with pharmacological means. On the one hand, the setting of a psychiatric outpatient department largely shapes the way depressive patients express their subjectivities. On the other hand, the diagnosis (and explanation) of depression as neurochemical imbalance and the prescription of drugs influences the way patients experience their suffering. Using two ethnographic examples, the aim of this paper is to analyze how subjectivities are construed and shaped in the process of negotiating depression in clinical encounters in mainstream psychiatric institutions in Kerala and how multiple framings and ontologies of affliction are assembled in them. Subjectivities of depression are, it will be argued, less coherent than ambigious and fractured, unstable and fragile. They engage, accentuate and sometimes merge different, often contradictory discourses. They should therefore better be referred to as ‘subjunctivities’. The idiom of depression often becomes a rhetorical device to emphasize affiliation to a scientific medical discourse or citizenship and is often a statement to emphasize ‘scientific temper’ and modernity and to demarcate oneself from backwardness and superstition."

The formation of an urban conglomeration in Calicut was made possible by the British administration, and the Basel mission, The British introduced Bungalows and other modern buildings in Malabar. Simultaneously, in Calicut, this gave a new touch to the construction patterns and it was against the existent caste-oriented house construction patterns. These buildings were constructed mainly for the administrative purpose of the British officials in Malabar."

    "abstract": "This paper attempts to situate Catholic prayer books, didactic and conduct books from the early twentieth century Kerala to understand how the community is appropriating, modifying and reproducing modernity through the texts they have produced. Religious dicta and prayers became a mode of operation through which the community negotiated modernity. Since book-production is determined by the social, political, economic and intellectual conditions of the time, it is significant to look into the local context that enabled the production of such books that are diverse from the secular books produced from the region in this period. This paper argues that the catholic engagement with print creates a contradiction in our understanding of modernity in Kerala. We often consider print as a vehicle of modemity. Adding a religious dimension and considering the realm of prayer books and didactic literature complicates our ideas of readership, imagination and sense of belonging,"

Trawling through an extraordinary set of sources such as colonial and post-colonial records, newspaper reports, unpublished autobiographies, private papers, photographs, and oral interviews, the author brings out a fascinating account of the transnational landscape of physical cultures, human and animal performers, and the circus industry. This book should be of interest to a wide range of readers from history, sociology, anthropology, and cultural studies to analysts of history of performance and sports in the subcontinent."

    "abstract": "This article offers vascularity as a multi-dimensional imaginary for the interspecies entanglements constituting Ayurvedic leech therapy. Whether, when, where, and how a leech decides to bite, suck, and release comprise pivotal junctures in leech therapy as practiced in southern Kerala, India. In the course of leech–human intra-actions, leeches translate matter, providing sensory mediation, relief, and amusement. Enmeshed in social and ecological relations inflected by gender, religion, class, and caste, this analysis of Ayurvedic leech therapy reframes questions of agencies starting with and from the viewpoint of the vascular capacities of leeches in their interactions with humans. This image of vascularity provides an analytic for the emergent agencies of humans and leeches constituted by sensory intra-actions at branching points in this multispecies clinical practice."

    "abstract": "The (post)colonial logics of speed and convenience are manifest in many of today’s infrastructural projects, creating what we consider to be ‘fast infrastructures’. These infrastructures create ease for some and harm for others while exacerbating social and environmental crises around the world. Addressing these crises requires, we argue, a slowing down. Enter the role of ‘slow infrastructures’. \n\nIn this paper, we highlight two forms of slow infrastructure that provide possibilities for rearranging our infrastructural orientations: composting and rainwater harvesting. Drawing on fieldwork conducted throughout 2018 and 2019 in Kochi, Kerala, this research asserts that in order to do infrastructure differently, an unworking of convenience and speed is required. \n\nThis unworking can be achieved through an attunement to multi-species and more-than-human relations, matched with a distributed ethic of maintenance and care. Our ethnographic examples, one from a hospital and another from a hotel, suggest that slow infrastructures can meaningfully offset the threat of disfunction and ‘urban failure’ that confronts cities increasingly marked by turbulence and uncertainty. While these examples draw from the tropics of urban South India, they offer lessons helpful to unworking the harm caused by fast infrastructures in other parts of the globe."

    "abstract": "This article examines the representation of transgender identity in contemporary Malayalam Cinema through the construction of trans femininity in the two films; Aalorukkam (2018) and Njan Marykutty (2018). Malayalam cinema has started to capture trans lives for the last two decades as trans people have appeared as side characters in a number of films. These films demarcate the transformation in Kerala’s public sphere as well as in Malayalam industry. The queer and transgender visibility politics and movement in the state influenced some recent films to place trans characters in central roles. Unlike the earlier films in which trans people are marginalized, victimized, and made fun of, the two films discussed in this article try to carve the identity of Malayali trans women who struggle against all the odds of society and stamp their space in a cisheteronormative society. The article critically looks at the construction of trans femininity, their sexuality, and the spaces of their gender performance in these films which try to satiate hegemonic social constructions."

    "abstract": "Under the aegis of the World Health Organization, the Movement for Global Mental Health and an Indian Supreme Court ruling, biomedical psychiatric interventions have expanded in India augmenting biomedical hegemony in a place that is known for its variety of healing modalities. This occurs despite the fact that studies by the WHO show better outcomes in India for people suffering from schizophrenia and related diagnoses when compared to people in developed countries with greater access to biomedical psychiatry. Practitioners of ayurvedic medicine in Kerala have been mounting a claim for a significant role in public mental health in the face of this growing hegemony. This study examines efforts by ayurvedic practitioners to expand access to ayurvedic mental health services in Kerala, and profiles a rehabilitation center which combines biomedical and ayurvedic therapies and has been a key player in efforts to expand the use of Ayurveda for mental health. The paper argues for maintaining a pluralistic healing environment for treating mental illness rather than displacing other healing modalities in favor of a biomedical psychiatric approach."

Uniquely interdisciplinary in style, this study synthesizes cultural history, ethnography, and theory to explore the continuities – historical, societal, and political – that characterize these ritual traditions across the subcontinent."

Our cases are from two ostensibly secular states – India and Nigeria – both former British colonies where secularism has been interrogated over the past few decades. \n\nIn our focus on what we call ‘lived’ Islam, we pay attention not only to intra‐Muslim differences but also to how religiosity is formed and experienced through engagement and encounters with Others, whether religious, ethnic or political, both locally and globally. \n\nEveryday religiosity in such settings as South India and Nigeria emerges at the interstices of such encounters where Muslims often seek to draw boundaries at the same time as they fashion themselves – in lifestyle, sociality, aesthetics – in relation to various Others. \n\nAs we argue, such ethnographic cases with their comparative angle underscore the importance of studying religiosity in heterogeneous settings so as to explode the flawed, idealised sense of wholeness that emerges in some of the literature on the anthropology of one religious tradition or another with such traditions sometimes represented as deriving from self‐contained theologies."

The actors and drummers create an entire world in the empty space of the stage by using spectacular costumes and make-up and by an immensely rich interplay of words, rhythms, mime, and gestures. \n\nThis volume focuses on Mantrankam and Anguliyankam, the two great masterpieces of Kutiyattam. It provides fundamental general remarks and relates them to pan-Indian reflections on aesthetics, philology, ritual studies, and history. \n\nAuthored by scholars and active Kutiyattam performers, this is the first attempt to bring together a set of sustained, multi-faceted interpretations of these masterpieces-in-performance. With an aim to open up this ancient art form to readers interested in South Indian culture, religion, theatre and performance studies, philology, as well as literature, this volume offers a new way to access a major art form of pre-modern and modern Kerala. \n\nThe University of Tuebingen in Germany and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel were partners in a long-term project studying and documenting Kutiyattam performances, including initiating full-scale performances of major works in the classical repertoire. We have been, in particular, focusing on the study of the two major, complex and ancient works, Mantrankam and Anguliyankam, both of which we have seen and recorded in full. The articles in this volume are one of the results. They are supplemented with video-clips of lecture demonstrations provided online."

    "abstract": "Efforts by governments in developing countries to economically empower rural women rarely focus on farming, an occupation in which the majority have experience. Those that do are typically directed at women within family farms, rather than at creating group-based alternatives outside the familial domain. \n\nIn this context, two state-level initiatives in India, launched in the early 2000s, stand out, for their innovative experiment in group farming. They encouraged women to collectively cultivate leased land and become farm managers in their own right. \n\nBased on the author’s detailed quantitative and qualitative surveys in the states of Telangana and Kerala, this paper analyses whether farming in groups empowers women economically as well as socially and politically. \n\nAlso, given the divergent implementation strategy of the two states, which approach is more effective and why? The lessons learnt can provide pointers for replication elsewhere."

The questionnaire method was used to collect data for the study. The study was conducted among the research scholars of four selected universities in Kerala, India.\n\nFindings: This study has analysed the services and resources in the libraries which are provided through the medium of the internet and also the usage patterns of web information services by the scholars of the selected universities. The analysis reveals that most of the university libraries have implemented web-based information services. However, the extent of usage is not to the expected level and this is due to the lack of sufficient awareness about the usage methods of web resources and services. With the help of proper user education and training programs, the present situation can be ameliorated. The findings of this study can be helpful to the authorities to improve the services in the libraries.\n\nOriginality/value: Proper use of library resources is essential for scholars to bring forth productive research outputs. This study provides recommendations for enhancing web-based services in university libraries in Kerala to provide better services to the users."

    "abstract": "The Church Missionary Society ‘Mission of Help’ to the Syrian Church of Travancore in the 19th century provides much instructive food for thought concerning debates that continue in mission up to the present day. In particular, the episode shows that the links between mission and empire cannot be reduced to seeing mission as a mere handmaiden to imperial concerns, although empire certainly provided a context to missionary endeavour throughout the imperial period. \n\nIn this specific instance, it was the forceful personality of Colonel John Munro, who ensured that the Mission of Help became more intertwined with empire than might otherwise have been the case. Another effect of this imperial context for the Mission of Help was that the nature and scope of mission inevitably ended up being broadened to include aspects of societal transformation. It is shown that Benjamin Bailey was not primarily motivated by such concerns, yet was not unconcerned about them. Bailey’s thinking through of these tensions perhaps provide a way to think today about the links between the ‘Great Commission’, the ‘Great Commandment’, and cultural transformation."

    "abstract": "This study explores the patterns and determinants of construction-led migration and measures the existing wage differential between migrant and native workers in Kerala using both secondary and primary data. \n\nWhile secondary data were compiled from Census and NSS migration surveys, primary data were collected from three districts of Kerala using a stratified random sampling method. \n\nIt is found that the pattern of internal migration is changing in Kerala with a declining share of migrants from neighbouring states, along with the corresponding upsurge in the inflows from far-off states like West Bengal, Assam and Bihar. Though poverty and rising unemployment at the place of origin are the pushing factors, relatively higher wages and availability of employment throughout the years are the main pulling factors of in-migration to Kerala. \n\nSince a higher proportion of remittance is spent on basic necessities like food, clothing and housing consumptions, it has positive implication on poverty reduction at the origin states. However, it is noted that migrant workers, on the average, earn less than their non-migrants counterparts in Kerala. \n\nGiven the importance of these low-skilled migrants in sustaining the long-term economic growth in Kerala, their poor and unhygienic living arrangements should also attract the attention of the policy makers."

While all cadets appreciated the exposure provided by the cadet programme, the programme’s practical logic of risk reduction and efficiency enabled English-educated cadets to emerge as ‘ready-made leaders’ requiring very little training."

    "abstract": "<i>Kshetra punarudharanam</i> (temple revival) is a phrase one often comes across today in Kerala’s public spaces. It attests to an increasing presence of spike in temple activities in Kerala. This is seemingly in sharp contrast to the powerful representation of the state as a rational, enlightened entity with a strong Left/communist tradition and a strong developmental imperative.\n\nThis article argues that religion has been a significant strand in modern-day Kerala and that it has interfaced intimately with various secular progressive and developmental articulations of this region. Even when secular progressive sections mounted profound criticisms against faith and ritual, temples continuously reinvented and reshaped their relevance. \n\nIn fact, this paper argues that there was a significant simultaneity in the powerful critiques of religion/religiosity on the one hand, and the various calls for <i>kshetra punarudharanam</i> on the other. \n\nThe paper argues that, contrary to the dominant perception of its irrepressible disappearance (and thus the ‘revival’), religion continued to be both present and significant in what is constituted as the public."

Along with union government, various state governments also have made their state-level policies to support the start-ups in their respective states. Apart from the government, there are many other institutions and ecosystem enablers in a start-up ecosystem who support start-up units, namely incubators, accelerators, educational institutions, research institutions, investors, mentors, NGOs etc. \n\nThe purpose of this study is to explore how technology business incubation centres in Kerala are performing their role as a facilitator among start-ups in the state and also to evaluate their impact on functioning of start-ups units."

The author analyzes the dynamics of “privilege” and “subordination” in this community from a feminist perspective by examining historical and religious texts; analyzing clothing, minority rights, and protest movements; interviewing and examining the contemporary ways in which Syrian Christians interact within and outside the community.The author begins to set the stage for her thesis by briefly touching upon the history of Kerala, Syrian Christians, and social reforms. The Syrian Christians had for long enjoyed a higher social status in society and were similar to upper-caste Hindus in terms of privileges and status. The exceptional social indicators and statistics of the Kerala developmental paradigm tend, however, to conceal many issues, namely, gender discrimination, caste-based violence, and patriarchy (34).The second chapter seemed to me the most insightful. There, Thomas uses the lens of clothing to expose the gender paradox within the community. Clothes can"

It has increased the income of recipient households and enabled them to spend more on human capital investment. \n\nUsing data from the Kerala Migration Survey-2010, this study analyses the impact of remittance receipts on the households’ healthcare expenditure and access to private healthcare in Kerala. This study employs an instrumental variable approach to account for the endogeneity of remittances receipts. \n\nThe empirical results show that remittance income has a positive and significant impact on households’ healthcare expenditure and access to private healthcare services. After disaggregating the sample into different heterogeneous groups, this study found that remittances have a greater effect on lower-income households and Other Backward Class (OBC) households but not Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST) households, which remain excluded from reaping the benefit of international migration and remittances."

Categories like ‘tiller’ and ‘tenant,’ though they did drive the postcolonial process forward, drew from the colonial legal order. This, ironically, resulted in the exclusion of the tribes."

    "abstract": "This article reports a study of the interlinkages among remittance receipts, household-level investment and the changing emigration patterns in Kerala, using seven rounds of the Kerala Migration Survey conducted between 1998 and 2018. The major findings suggest that remittances improved households’ per capita income and changed their spending patterns. Households receiving remittance, on average, spare a relatively larger share of monthly income on the consumption of non-food durable goods. Moreover, receipts of remittance also enable the households to save, to invest more on assets, land and buildings, and to form human capital (through increased share of spending on education and health). Households which devote a large share of spending on education and health also report a relatively high share of skilled emigration to either Global North or Oceania regions, instead of the traditional low-skilled Gulf emigration. Hence, policies that help boost these new emigration trends are likely to sustain the growth of remittance inflows and the process of overall socio-economic development in Kerala."

Manuscript collections in India show that Arabic historical texts from the Red Sea region had a readership in the subcontinent. Most importantly, mobile scholars began to compose Arabic histories while receiving patronage at the western Indian courts. Scholarly mobilities fostered cultural exchanges, which increasingly built on a shared history, written, read, and circulated in Arabic during the 16th century"

The ageing process in Kerala is witnessing an increase in the ratio of elderly population along with fundamental changes in families and communities. Hence, in order to accommodate the needs of the ageing population in society, various systems need to be reconstructed. The concerns and issues surrounding the ageing population requires long-term attentiveness and forward planning, where policies must be adopted with consideration for cultural and social contexts. Care for the elderly should focus on a holistic combination of health care, socio-economic protection and provision of a suitable environment for better quality of life."

Furthermore, there is a need to ‘unlearn’ or ‘discard’ the prevailing traditional learning and accountability practices; unless this is achieved, a conducive environment for learning accountability cannot be institutionalised, nor can reforms such as the CF be materialised."

These initiatives are the outcome of a restorative justice approach which aims to reduce future offences by bringing back offenders to normal life by rehabilitation and restoration. Prisoners’ lives in prisons were very difficult in the Indian context till the last decade. \n\nDifferent rehabilitative approaches have been introduced inside prisons but, after release, the number of social re-entry initiatives is much less. The released face many psycho-social and economic issues which may destroy a person’s ability to adjust with the services provided. The national prison policy of India recommends aftercare services for the rehabilitation of released prisoners. The labelling and social stigma due to the crime hinders prisoners’ ability to re-enter society after release. \n\nIn this context, the present paper explored the issues and challenges faced by the released prisoners during their social re-entry and came up with rehabilitative initiatives for a better restoration process in the Indian context."

    "abstract": "This study examines the asset gains to households in Kerala, India, from two types of labor migration: moving overseas versus moving within India for employment. It draws on panel data from waves of a representative household survey conducted in 1998 and 2003. Migrant households as a whole experienced higher asset gains than non-migrant families over this five-year period. Contrary to theoretical expectations, asset gains were similar for households with an overseas migrant and those with a domestic migrant. Although less educated individuals tend to venture overseas, a wage premium over non-migrants enables them to earn as much in low-skill jobs abroad as more educated workers relocating within India can."

    "abstract": "Cinema exhibition houses provide the necessary settings for Indian audience to engage with cinema. Theatre and its overall practices ranging from film publicity to screening cinema helps the cinemagoers to construct the physical and spatial sense of film viewing. In India, post-release film publicity is done by exhibitors in their respective areas. \n\nExhibitors use film posters/notices/advertisements to attract audiences to their cinema theatre. Apart from conventional publicity media, exhibitors use digital platforms like mobile phones and social media to reach cinemagoers. This study explores one such attempt by a rural single screen theatre in Kannur District of Kerala to reach its audience. \n\nWhen majority of nearby single screen theatres closed down due to declining audience attendance ‘Rani Talkies Vengad’ survived by adapting new ways of reaching the audience. While retaining the conventional publicity spaces and methods, this C-class theatre is active on social media sites with its regular updates about film changes and show timings. \n\nThis paper looks at cinema as a holistic experience and attempts to write the local film history of Vengad Rani by looking into the thick terrain of cinema that lies outside the cinematic text."

We focus primarily on network size, as well as the type and location of relationships. \n\nGrounded in interaction ritual theory, Ling’s bounded solidarity thesis suggests that mobile communication may reconfigure social bonds, leading to a focus on family and friends over workmates and acquaintances, as well as more local networks. \n\nThis study analyses data from three waves of data (2002–2013) from the state of Kerala. Our key findings are generally consistent with bounded solidarity: family ties increased at the expense of work ties, and there was a shift away from regional and international ties towards local relationships."

The article concludes by drawing attention to the rent-seeking behaviour associated with intermediaries."

Data include in-depth interviews, observations, and photography with older adults in care homes. \n\nWe identify three types of cherished possessions that are embodied with different roles and emotional qualities: first, religious artifacts that signify a sense of security in day-to-day life; second, possessions embedded with memories of past life events that elicit pride and a sense of continuity; and, third, possessions linked to memories of family members and pets, which reflect efforts to create a sense of co-presence. \n\nThis paper contributes to a new dialogue on how empirical research on home-making practices can enrich and sustain the emotional well-being of older adults living in care homes."

Though parents were involved hands on in their child’s training under professional direction, they remained mere information providers in decision making. The parent–professional relationship did not nurture parent’s self efficacy. This led to parents feeling inadequate to provide for their child’s developmental needs and being apprehensive about adulthood. The customary nature of parent–professional relationship observed may be a reflection of the collectivist culture in India. \n\nThe need for parent-mediated interventions and for it to focus on enabling parents to break cultural barriers that might be holding them back from partnering with professionals on equal terms is discussed."

Alors que les performeurs de la nouvelle génération essaient de concilier l’exigence de cette pratique avec une amélioration de leurs conditions de vie, des performeurs plus âgés, qui valorisent l’idée d’un sacrifice de soi pour la communauté, alimentent un débat au sujet de leur compétence. Au cœur de ce débat, il y a des enjeux interreliés se rapportant à la notion d’authenticité donnant lieu à des interprétations, ancrées à la fois dans l’imaginaire mythique et contestataire du Teyyam de même que dans la réalité de l’Inde actuelle, qui orientent les conceptions de part et d’autre, et rappellent l’importance de répondre à la nécessité de convaincre que les dieux pourront toujours continuer à intervenir en faveur des fidèles.

While the performers of the new generation try to reconcile the demands of this practice with an improvement in their living conditions, older performers, who value the idea of self-sacrifice for the community, are fuelling a debate in subject of their competence. At the heart of this debate, there are interrelated issues relating to the notion of authenticity giving rise to interpretations, anchored both in the mythical and protest imagination of Teyyam as well as in the reality of contemporary India, which guide the conceptions of both sides, and recall the importance of responding to the need to convince that the Gods can always continue to intervene in favour of the faithful. What happens when criteria for confirming the presence of a deity during a ritual are reinterpreted? What must they satisfy to ensure consensus?]"

    "abstract": "One of the most important Hindu Tantric rites is known as <i>dīksa,</i> an initiation that grants access to mystical knowledge. This initiation enables the individual to perform rites on their own and learn secret spiritual practices from an enlightened master of the tradition. A person who undergoes diksa is never a mere spectator of ritual ceremonies; rather they play an important role in the rituals: they are cognisant of the esoteric techniques and powerful incantations involved. \n\nThe aim of this article is to reflect on the meaning of diksa according to a Tantric text of Kerala entitled <i>Matrsadbhava</i>. It highlights important aspects of the initiation that are mentioned in the text, namely, Tantric visualisations, purification of an adept, the transmission of mantras, and the interpretation of dreams. These are subsequently compared with initiatory practices in modern Tantric groups of Kerala."

    "abstract": "The theoretical framework of greed and grievance provides a perspective for understanding conflicts in a social set-up that comprises competing interests. The greed of a section of a society to maximise its control over resources (social, political and economic) is often combined with the grievances of sections that are deprived of their shares of the resources. Even within such considerations, the positions of greed and grievance are fluidic in any conflict and are a critical factor in the manufacturing and sustaining of conflicts. The Kizhakkambalam Gram Panchayat (GP) in Kerala offers one such opportunity to investigate and explore the conflicts arising from the interactive and shifting nature of greed and grievances. Based on an ethnographic survey of the GP, this study highlights and investigates the role of a corporate functionary, Twenty20, and its interactions with the local population. The study argues that the dominance of the Twenty20 in local politics through electoral victory achieved by leveraging corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives is seen to be oscillating between being perceived as a product for managing social grievances and as a product for actualising corporate greed. The interactive and fluidic nature of greed and grievances creates tensions among multiple actors and leads to conflicts in the GP."

This tradition incorporates the ritualistic practices of Kashmirian Saivism or, more precisely, it integrates Krama-Trika ritualism with the folk mythology of Kerala and Srividya theology. \n\nThis study presents the hypothesis that the Sakta tradition of Kerala could have been influenced directly by proponents of Kashmirian Saivism and indirectly by Srīvidya. The Tantric texts of Kerala reveal that Srīvidya infiltrated many ritualistic traditions and was held in high esteem by practitioners and devotees. \n\nIt was a claim of some Tantric practitioners of Kerala that authoritative Tantric treatises such as <i>Sesasamuccaya</i> and <i>Matṛsadbhava</i> may have been composed by Brahmins, who intended to incorporate the well-established and probably influential and socially attractive Sakteya cults into their own realm. Therefore, the paper attempts to show that Srīvidya is a link that unites Tantric traditions of modern Kerala."

    "abstract": "This article examines the relations between trade, faith, and textual traditions in early modern Indian Ocean region and the birth of Arabi-Malayalam, a new system of writing which has facilitated the growth of a vernacular Islamic textual tradition in Malabar since the seventeenth century. As a transliterated scriptorial-literary tradition, Arabi-Malayalam emerged out of the polyglossic lingual sphere of the Malabar Coast, and remains as one of the important legacies of social and religious interactions in precolonial south Asia. The first part of this article examines the social, epistemic and normative reasons that led to the scriptorial birth of Arabi-Malayalam, moving beyond a handful of Malayalam writings that locate its origin in the social and economic necessities of Arab traders in the early centuries of Islam. The second part looks at the complex relationship between Muslim scribes and their vernacular audience in the aftermath of Portuguese violence and destruction of Calicut—one of the largest Indian Ocean ports before the sixteenth century. This part focuses on Qadi Muhammed bin Abdul Aziz and his Muhiyuddinmala, the first identifiable text in Arabi-Malayalam, examining how the Muhiyuddinmala represents a transition from classical Arabic theological episteme to the vernacular-popular poetic discourse which changed the pietistic behaviour of the Mappila Muslims of Malabar."

    "abstract": "What happens when courts reach ‘good’ outcomes through ‘bad’ reasoning? Are there limits to consequentialist jurisprudence? The Indian Supreme Court’s recent decision in IYLA <i>v.</i> State of Kerala offers important insights on both issues. \n\nIYLA, decided in September 2018, held that the Hindu temple at Sabarimala may not ban women aged ten to fifty from its premises even though devotees argue the exclusion is religiously mandated. Reactions to IYLA have been vehement and violent, and so far only two women in the prohibited age range have managed to visit the temple. Perhaps any outcome impinging on religious practice would have elicited such responses. Nevertheless, the Court’s analysis, which disregarded devotee perspectives in its eagerness to acknowledge the previously overlooked perspectives of women, is problematic insofar as it superficially upholds the Court’s reputation as a progressive institution while creating bad precedent by further damaging the ‘essential practices’ doctrine. \n\nThis article draws on case law and legal analysis to demonstrate how the Court’s reasoning paid short shrift to its own doctrines and to conflicting imperatives in the Indian Constitution. The Court’s (and ruling’s) failures underscore the extent to which winning good outcomes through bad reasoning should be sobering rather than satisfying."

    "abstract": "The paper probes the historical and cultural-utopian rationale behind the wide acceptability of ‘Kiss of Love’ (KoL) movement in India that sprang up during 2015 and assesses its theoretical significance as a heterotopic social movement. Heterotopia embodies tensions between place and non-place in public spaces. In the Indian context, streets have been places of extreme social segregation in terms of caste, gender and sexuality. Heterotopia does not mark ‘liberation’ or ‘confinement’, but produces sites porous with openings so that the possibilities of alternate lives remain open. In this reconstitution of public spaces for resistance, ‘a passion for improvisation’ articulates acts of resistance in the mediated environments of post-civil society social movements that remain absorbent, always in flux, always contested and never predetermined."

    "abstract": "This paper analyses indigenous ecotourism in the Indian district of Wayanad, Kerala, using a conceptual framework based on a PATA 2015 study on indigenous tourism that includes the criteria: human rights, participation, business and ecology. Detailed indicator sets for each criterion are applied to a case study of the Priyadarshini Tea Environs with a qualitative research approach addressing stakeholders from the public sector, non-governmental organisations, academia, tour operators and communities including Adivasi and non-Adivasi. In-depth interviews were supported by participant and non-participant observations. The authors adapted this framework to the needs of the case study and consider that this modified version is a useful tool for academics and practitioners wishing to evaluate and develop indigenous ecotourism projects. The results show that the Adivasi involved in the Priyadarshini Tea Environs project benefit from indigenous ecotourism. But they could profit more if they had more involvement in and control of the whole tourism value chain."

    "abstract": "Historically, the role of ‘self-help groups’ (SHGs) has been highlighted by different authors. The term used widely as cooperation for survival. SHGs play a significant role in transforming the rural economy. Its unprecedented growth helps the resurgence of the weaker section of society in terms of outreach, social position and sustainability. Among different SHGs, ‘Kudumbashree’ of Kerala constitute the largest women SHGs in India. The Government of Kerala launched the programme for poor women on 17 May 1998. Grassroots of ‘Kudumbashree’ are ‘Neighbourhood Groups’ (NHGs). Kudumbashree functions through NHGs.\n\nThe present study analyses the social impact of NHGs by taking samples from the tribal and non-tribal areas in the district of Palakkad, Kerala. A detailed survey conducted among 600 respondents with identified social variables. The outcome of the study reveals that NHGs have created a social platform for women to improve social activities and strengthen its members’ social bondage. The social impacts in tribal and non-tribal areas differ for certain social variables and do not vary with others. Overall, the study highlights the need for promoting the role of NHGs as a means of ‘social change’ for strengthening the socialization process of women."

    "abstract": "The ritual of the teyyams, in north Kerala, has been referred to as ‘art form’, ‘folk art’, ‘ritual art’, and such, not only by tourist guides and leaflets, but also by academic works and, more and more, in the everyday speech of local communities. \n\nIn this article we intend to question the adequacy of such categorisations, in light of plausible definitions of art and folklore, and investigate the motivations for such classifications, considering the correlations of social and political power in post-colonial circumstances. \n\nWe defend a need for an integrated, informed, and careful address to the cult of the teyyams (like any other post-colonial reality) and argue that the post-colonial discourse, despite its advantages over colonial rhetoric, can still be improved upon. It can be improved upon by acknowledging, besides the obvious consequences of the colonialist cultural and political heritage, the traces of the local, more ancient or discrete influences, interlaced with the later colonial heritage, and can provide clues for understanding of the present in its complexity. \n\nThe example of the teyyams is not a random choice but rather a specific example in which the history of the relations of power, which continues from pre-colonial times, is visible on the one hand in local political discussions, and on the other hand has been fully inscribed, as tension and transgression, into the ritual in a metaphorical way."

Over the succeeding two decades and more, PB has become securely institutionalized, surviving numerous changes of ruling party at state level. Outside of Kerala, however, few LGUs of any sort have implemented PB and it has not flourished in any of the adopters. \n\nUsing the World Bank’s principal-agent model of state accountability for public service delivery, this paper will explore Kerala’s experience at PB and more briefly look at its lack of success elsewhere in India."

In Germany, care for the elderly and nursing in hospitals are marked by strategies of familialisation and voluntarisation, of standardisation and digital surveillance and by transnationalisation through the import of migrant workers. \n\nIn India’s rural health provision, voluntarism subsidises welfarism; in private and public hospitals, hierarchisation and contractualisation of employment deepen care extraction. Stereotypes of nursing as natural female, caste norms and various stigmata reinforce the low valuation of care work. \n\nIn both countries, neoliberal policies merge with patriarchal structures of social reproduction, intensify care extraction and create a cheap care work force which however is no longer docile."

    "abstract": "The momentous interaction between Portugal and Kerala com­menced with the historic voyage of Vasco da Gama in 1498. It had lasting impact on the society of Kerala. The voyage, with the express purpose of searching for ‘Christians and Spices’, left longlasting imprint on the life of the people of Kerala.\n\nThough the Portuguese did not have political dominion in Kerala, the political influence they gained in Kerala precipitated a lot of socio-cultural changes. The intensity and degree of these changes were commensurate with the tenor of the Portuguese networking with the diverse socio-cultural traits in Kerala. Those sections of the Kerala society that gained a higher extent of interconnectedness with the Portuguese manifested a higher degree of socio-cultural transition. \n\nOne of the most significant means for socio-cultural change that the Portuguese employed in Kerala was ecclesiastical legislation. This cultural interface between Portugal and Kerala resulted in multiple fissions and fusions in the society of Kerala.\n\nThis book delves deep into the multifarious interaction between the two communities and the consequent socio-cultural changes that Kerala witnessed during 1498-1663, the period when Portuguese influence was at its acme."

    "abstract": "The theory of male gaze was first introduced by Laura Mulvey in her 1975 essay ‘Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema.’ According to Mulvey (Screen 16: 6–18, 1975), cinema reflects the oblivion of patriarchal society and reinforces the notion that women are the subject of heterosexual male control and desire (Superson in Hypatia 26: 410–418, 2011). \n\nThe function of cinema, according to Laura Mulvey, is to serve as a voyeuristic medium that encourages the audience to take pleasure from looking upon. Many Hollywood movies, especially the films of Hitchcock and Sternberg, were widely studied on the basis of this version of psychoanalytic theory. Subsequently, new sources for revitalising feminist film theory emerged through performance studies, new media studies, phenomenology and Deleuzian philosophy. These are theoretical frameworks that move beyond the semiotic preoccupation with meaning, representation and interpretation. \n\nTaking Mulvey’s analysis as its starting point, this chapter examines the specific techniques of the veteran Malayalam filmmaker, K. G. George’s representation of women in his film <i>Adaminte Variyellu</i> (Adam’s Rib) and men in <i>Panchavadi Palam</i> (Panchavadi Bridge) in order to suggest an alternative way of understanding the status of women and men in these works. \n\nIn particular, this chapter aims to mobilise Gilles Deleuze’s work on cinema and other artistic media in order to argue the case that K. G. George’s films offer his characters a status that can be enjoyed by the spectator without any preconceived notions. The Deleuzian approach allows for a less negative outlook on desire, subjectivity and identity; opening up readings of film as embodying many forms of desire and creating experiences of affirmation for the spectator (Smelik in Wiley Blackwell Encycl Gend Sex Stud: 1–5, 2016)."

    "abstract": "Current debates in India on work, employment and labour markets have paid rather little attention to three important distinctions: between sustainable livelihoods and labour force participation; between autonomously managing non-family enterprises versus participation in decision-making within the confines of family enterprises; and between cooperation among workers for larger economic returns versus atomised individuals competing for work or livelihoods in unequal markets. \n\nThis paper conceptually outlines the importance of focusing on work through the lens of livelihoods, autonomy and collectivity, especially for women. Empirically, it analyses whether group farming, wherein women farmers voluntarily pool land, labour, capital and skills to cultivate jointly, while sharing costs and benefits, can help them overcome their production constraints, create viable livelihoods, and gain autonomous identities as farmers? How well can women’s group farms perform in comparison with male-managed small family farms? \n\nBased on meticulously undertaken primary surveys of group farming in Kerala and Telangana, the paper compares all-women group farms with largely male-managed small family farms in the same state, in terms of productivity and profits. It also examines the impact on women’s skill capabilities and status, which state is more effective and why, and the lessons these experiences hold for replication elsewhere. New and emerging experiments with farmers’ collectives in eastern India and Gujarat, including all-male and mixed-gender groups, suggest that the group farming model can be adapted effectively to varying contexts. The paper thus demonstrates the importance and potential of transforming the institutions within which work is done, in order to enhance both worker well-being and productivity gains. In conclusion, it reflects on the concept of the Social and Solidarity Economy."

This article analyses the life-story narratives of women domestic workers and tries to understand the construction of their particular gendered subject positions within the transnational activities. \n\nThe purpose is to move beyond the binary logic of legal and illegal migration to understand the grey areas of transnational migration. Is it possible to move beyond the state when state and non-state activities are not clearly demarcated and not mutually exclusive? How do we study the non-state activities which contribute to the construction of particular gendered subjects along with the state’s own production of gendered subjects and citizenship?"

Since the turn of the 20th century, there has been a considerable rise in the cultural recontextualisation of European and North American medical traditions in South Asia. \n\nWith a focus on the guiding concepts of vitality, self-healing and ecology, this article maps the transnational trajectories of naturopathy across three sites: its instantiation into the United States’ early 1900s cultural climate of health epidemics and industrialisation; its rearticulation into the context of Gandhian anti-colonial movements in India; and its transformation into a mode of asserting public health and environmental advocacy in contemporary India. \n\nAfter tracing the trajectory of naturopathic thought, this article will provide a practitioner profile of naturopathy Dr Jacob Vadakkanchery as well as a framing of his politicised response to the 2018 floods in Kerala, south India. This particular examination serves as a microcosm of a larger trend: contemporary practitioners in India overtly re-frame naturopathic concepts in relation to immanent environmental and public health concerns."

    "abstract": "Human-wildlife conflict (HWC) is a major challenge for conservation biologists worldwide. To counter negative attitudes of people towards wildlife species, government agencies or non-governmental organizations (NGOs) frequently provide monetary compensation for losses due to crop damage or livestock depredation by wildlife. \n\nWhile much has been written about the challenges of using compensation schemes as a wildlife conservation tool, there has been little investigation into alternative potential benefits of compensation records. We suggest that compensation records can be used to obtain a summary overview of wildlife conflict instances that occur in a region and thereby provide an understanding of the distribution of HWC across a landscape. Further, these records provide insights on the economic prioritization given to each of the species involved in HWC and the kind of damage they cause. \n\nWe tested this premise through a case study of human-elephant conflict (HEC) in districts of Kerala in southern India using state government-maintained compensation records. To this end, we constructed a conflict index and found Wayanad, Palakkad, and Kannur to be the districts most affected by HEC. \n\nAn overall distribution map of HEC in any region is crucial to formulating mitigation policies for conflict management. Findings from our study, based on the compensation records, present a holistic view of conflict occurrences in Kerala and thus provide data that can be used to develop basic management strategies for HEC in the state."

Retired workers were worst-affected, since the plantation companies—under the disguise of the crisis—deferred their service payout. This article seeks to understand the severe alienation of the retirees as they struggle to regain lost respect, kinship network, and everyday sociality in the plantations and beyond. I argue that the alienation produced through their dispossession as wage labourers and the discrimination as Tamil-speaking Dalits must be understood as an interrelated process, whereas the source of alienation cannot be reduced to production or categorical relations alone."

    "abstract": "The asura's demise at the hands of the goddess is a theme frequently revisited in Hindu myth. It is the chronicle of a death foretold. \n\nSo too is the Bhadrakalimahtmya, a 16th-century regional puraṇa from Kerala, that narrates the tale of fierce goddess Bhadrakali and her predestined triumph over asura king Darika. Violence is ubiquitous in this narrative, which was designed with one goal in mind: glorifying the ultimate act of defeating the asura enemy. In its course the story exhibits many kinds of violence: self-harm, cosmic warfare, murder, etc. \n\nThis paper argues that (1) violence comes to serve as a structural aspect in the text. Reappearing consistently at key moments in the narrative, violence both frames and structures the goddess's tale. Yet, it is not only the violent act that dominates, it is its accompaniment by equal acts of regeneration that dictates the flow of the narrative, creating a pulsating course of endings and beginnings; (2) these cycles, that strategically occur throughout the narrative, come to serve as a Leitmotif referring to the cyclic tandem of destruction and regeneration that has dominated post-Vedic Hindu myth in many forms. The pulsating dynamic of death and revival thus becomes a specific narrative design that aims to embed the regional goddess within a grander framework of Time."

But looking at it through the lens of folk narrative and the popular, devotion-infused and highly personalised opinions of her devotees shows that not only the understanding, but also the acceptance of this violence and the connected anger and bloodthirst that are usually attached to it, as well as the feelings of fear and danger that arise from them on the devotees' end, are subjects open to discussion. \n\nThis article, at the juncture between anthropology, performance, and Hindu studies, analyses and compares discourses about her Malayali counterpart, Bhadrakali, drawing simultaneously on various versions of her founding myth of Darikavadham (‘The Slaying of Darikan’), ritual routines of her temples in Central Kerala as well as ritual performing arts that are conducted in some of them. \n\nThe concluding discussion of her alleged thirst for blood and identification of the ‘real’ addressee of blood offerings made to her particularly illustrates how far the negotiation of Bhadrakaḷi's use of violence and her very definition as violent goddess reaches deep into the worshipper/deity relationship that lies at the heart of popular worship."

    "abstract": "This article explores the nature of urban citizenship among fishers in Kerala, one of the state’s most marginalised communities, by analysing their participation in a centrally sponsored slum rehabilitation programme—Rajiv Awas Yojana (RAY)—in Vizhinjam, Thiruvananthapuram. The ‘right to participate’ is considered an integral part of the ‘right to the city’, and the inability of the fishing community to participate in the decision-making processes of urban development programmes that directly affect their lives reveals the exclusionary nature of their citizenship. In a state that is renowned for its achievements in human development and governance, the fishing community continues to be marginalised and lack collective power to influence policies. Participatory meetings in such contexts become tokenistic, and their transformative capacity is undermined. The inefficiency of participatory meetings organised under RAY also stems from the powerlessness of local governments to alter urban programmes designed by national governments."

The sample sentences demonstrating grammatical categories and rules are mostly drawn from actual speech samples.\n\nReading practices draw upon Vaikom Muhammad Basheer’s Pattuma’s Goat and Sooranad Ravi’s prose adaptation of The Story of Niliyamma’s Apotheosis, aiming to expose the learners to various aspects of Kerala culture.\n\nAdditionally, the book includes three chapters on Old Malayalam morphology, demonstrated by verses from classical compositions such as the Uṇṇunīlisandeśam and the Kṛṣṇagātha, as well as regional literary traditions—a Teyyam song, Arabic- and Jewish-Malayalam verses, and Syriac Malayalam prose—for exposing the learners to the literary traditions in Malayalam dialects and religiolects.\n\nTen indices follow with charts of kinship terms, verbal and nominal forms, a glossary, and bibliographical references. The book is thus an invitation for an in-depth engagement with the study of Kerala’s lush linguistic landscape and diverse literary culture past and present."

    "abstract": "This article examines the processes involved in the creation of a caste community called the Dheevaras in the South Indian state of Kerala in the early twentieth century. Although deemed an untouchable caste, the Dheevaras contested their untouchable status through various myths and histories, and this contestation was reflected in the Dheevara reform movement’s continuities with and departures from mainstream Hinduism and the caste system. While Dheevara reformers advocated a mainstream Hindu identity and claimed an honoured past for the community, they challenged Sanskritic Hinduism in defending the occupation of fishing. The reformers, however, strictly followed upper-caste Hindu patriarchal norms when imagining Dheevara womanhood, making women the bearers of caste honour."

It presents the 5th State Finance Commission’s approach and methodology on the devolution of State taxes to local governments.\n\nThis book presents a number of lessons on the transfer of financial powers, mobilisation of own sources of revenue and inter-governmental transfer of funds, and argues that the outcome of fiscal decentralisation in Kerala is poor or unsatisfactory due to partial and distorted implementation.\n\nIt shows that transferring a large number of expenditure functions at an early stage of fiscal decentralisation without the assignment of adequate administrative and financial powers has resulted in poor execution of all the functions. The study points out the need to move from partial to full fiscal decentralisation."

Here we use large-scale surveys (10,000 households) from two Indian states, Kerala and Rajasthan, to examine how education and attitudes toward cooking associate with the adoption of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), India’s most popular clean cooking fuel. We report three main results. First, education is a strong predictor of LPG adoption. Second, perceptions that LPG is good and affordable and progressive health-related perceptions are associated with LPG ownership. Third, and surprisingly, education does not predict positive attitudes toward clean cooking fuels. These results suggest that education leads to LPG adoption, but not through attitudinal changes. Further research should examine the mediators of the robust observed education-adoption association."

    "abstract": "Scenes of avarna castes (slave and intermediate castes) pondering their reflections recur throughout the history of anti-caste struggle in the princely state of Travancore in colonial-era south India. These scenes represent what I will call performative egalitarianisms, which are repetitive enactments in the performance of everyday lives that embody claims to equality against the dehumanising caste codes of colonial Travancore. \n\nIn this paper, I will describe three scenes that represent distinct yet intertwined routes for the flows of egalitarian discourses in colonial Kerala. The concept of equality emerged in Travancore, first, via Enlightenment values of the British Protestant missionaries, or soulful Enlightenment; second, as non-dualistic equality of Narayana Guru, or repurposed Advaita; and third, through the discourses and practices of a Tamil religious cult called Ayya Vazhi, or radical Siddha Saiva. \n\nIn viewing the flows of egalitarian discourse through the lens of performance, I demonstrate the method of intellectual histories in the repertoire which allows us to investigate how particular conceptual frameworks and discursive modes are transmitted, transformed, and embodied by people for whom these ideas are, quite literally, a matter of life and death. The intentional, productive, and empowering relationship between universals such as equality or humanity and the particular claims of anti-caste struggle in Kerala leads to a politics of practice that I describe as repurposing universals. \n\nThe centrality of the notion of the human in the anti-caste politics of colonial-era Travancore leads me to refer to these flows of egalitarian discourses and the political struggles that they empowered as genealogies of the human. \n\nIn sum, I analyse the genealogies of the human in colonial-era Travancore by focussing on three scenes exemplifying performative egalitarianisms: soulful Enlightenment, repurposed Advaita, and radical Siddha Saiva."

I argue that the colonies serve as an index of their inferior social status. It serves more of their ghettoisation than for their empowerment. It further distances them from society and helps to appropriate their labour. This is the continuation of the age-old practice of caste discrimination and deprivation that kept them away from the mainstream while appropriating their labour for the general development of society. This paper focuses on the rereading of social norms which evolved through my probing of the social history of ‘caste colony’ as part of my research, especially in Dalit women.\n&nbsp;"

In particular, this article explores how, by creating a Keralan Gulf-pravasi spectre, Unnikrishnan critically engages with a more varied version of Gulf diasporic experience and, therefore, a more complex definition of emigration itself."

I will specifically undertake a reading of <i>Achanurangatha Veedu</i> (A Home in which the Father Cannot Sleep, 2006) and deploy my analysis of <i>Drishyam</i> (Sight, 2013) as a point of contrast. \n\nIn both these films the primary focus are on fathers who are compelled to act in order to protect their adolescent daughters from sexual violence. The marginalised Dalit Christian father in <i>Achanurangatha Veedu</i> is mired in humiliation and physical breakdown as his search for justice ends in failure. In <i>Drishyam</i>, on the other hand, the father, who belongs to an upper caste and middle class location, acquires heroic proportions as he launches a thrilling set of operations to safeguard the realm of domesticity. \n\nMy analysis shows how in <i>Achanurangatha Veedu</i> the viewer is constantly buffeted between identification with the victimized father and a possibility of distancing where we step back and watch the spectacle of pathos. I argue that the film offers a possibility of critiquing social hierarchies in instances where we slip out of both of these modes of viewing and inhabit a more contingent and disorienting position. My focus is on the visual and aural transactions through which masculinity is reassembled in cinema and the practices of spectatorship it engenders."

This region, which is known for its monsoon climate (which involves a distinct temporal and spatial variation in rainfall), has experienced a decrease in annual rainfall over the last century. This study is aimed at investigating how smallholder farmers perceive climate change and at identifying the methods that these smallholders use to adapt to climate change. We use data collected from a survey of 215 households to compare the climate vulnerability of three watershed communities in Kerala. We find that the farmers perceive substantial increases in both temperature and the unpredictability of monsoons; this is in accordance with actual observed weather trends. The selection of effective adaptation strategies is one of the key challenges that smallholders face as they seek to reduce their vulnerability. The surveyed households simultaneously use various adaptation methods, including information and communication technology, crop and farm diversification, social networking through cooperatives, and soil and water conservation measures. The results of a binary regression model reveal that the household head's age, education and gender, as well as the farm's size and the household's size, assets, livestock ownership, poverty status and use of extension services, are all significantly correlated with the households' choices regarding adaptations to cope with climate change."

In some Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, official sources have acknowledged the highly deplorable state of life of the workers and have even opined that the unrest among workers is an expression of their angst. Governmental response to crises has varied across the GCC; from minimal regulation measures, to radical intervention for protection of rights of the workers. However, in the last decade, there are indications of a common GCC policy on migrant labour. Recent press reports also indicated fresh diplomatic moves in this direction."

    "abstract": "This chapter presents a historical and contemporary sociological profile of Indian trade diaspora in the Arabian Peninsula countries, namely Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Yemen. Although in modern times, the presence of Indian traders in the Persian Gulf region can be traced back to at least the sixteenth century in Oman, and the early nineteenth century in Bahrain, Yemen and the present-day UAE, it got consolidated during the inter-war period throughout the region. Indian traders’ status as ‘British subjects’ particularly helped them in this regard. Further fillip to Indian commercial and entrepreneurial activities was provided by the emergence of Gulf countries as oil-exporting economies since the mid-1970s. Liberalization of economies and opening of free-trade zones in many countries further helped the Indian entrepreneurs in launching a wide variety of commercial and trading activities in the region."

    "abstract": "This article intends to study the health conditions, medication and hospitalisation preferences, and the determinants of medication preferences of the elderly population in Kerala. It is based on the primary data collected from a sample of 801 households and three old-age homes (OAHs) in three districts of the state, namely Kozhikode, Ernakulum and Trivandrum. The evidence suggests that the elderly population are vulnerable to various chronic diseases and they tend to spend more on healthcare. In the absence of public provision of effective healthcare services in Kerala, the elderly spend out-of-pocket on health expenses and choose private hospitals for effective and better treatment. However, those who prefer government hospitals mostly belong to poor and marginalised groups, including the inmates of OAHs. With regard to the type of medicines, the elderly often prefer Ayurveda and Homeopathy to Allopathy medicines. Based on these findings, we suggest that the government intervention in terms of more health care facilities and health insurance schemes for the elderly is necessary to improve their quality of life."

    "abstract": "In a relatively short period of time, the Gulf region has positioned itself as the third most important labour-importing region in the world. Embarking on ambitious development projects and taking advantage of regional factors, the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries were able to provide a safe haven for millions of workers over the last four decades. The movement of workers to the region was so large that it altered the demographic structure of the GCC countries. Foreigners constitute on average more than half of the population in the region and in some countries, they are more than 80%. This chapter examines three periods of this migration phenomenon. First, we briefly summarize the history of labour migration to the region focusing on what made the Gulf a lucrative destination for many. Second, we provide an update on the current situation of the labour force in the region. Finally, in the third part, special attention is given to future opportunities and challenges that labour markets in the Gulf region are most likely to face."

    "abstract": "Women’s entry into the exclusively male-dominated field of Ayurveda in large numbers and their pursuit of a professional career as physicians, observed since the 1980s in India, are socially and historically significant events. Their overwhelming participation marks a rupture in the unchallenged control of the field by men of certain castes and families of medical lineages for centuries. In Kerala, interestingly, this has occurred when women’s overall workforce participation has remained low. \n\nThis article attempts to analyse women’s work in Ayurveda in Kerala and its consequences for Ayurvedic transformations in the state that are simultaneously aimed at consolidation of a regional identity and expansion of its global market. It analyses the experiences of women practitioners in the context of the local gender power dynamics and negotiations that define and direct their professional participation. \n\nHow do these women Ayurveda practitioners negotiate forces of professionalisation as well as gender marginalisation? What are the various personal and societal resources that they mobilise to succeed as Ayurveda practitioners? Do their subjectivities, negotiations and resources alter practices of Ayurveda and infuse it with different sensibilities? \n\nBased on interviews of women Ayurveda practitioners from diverse caste, religious and economic backgrounds, the paper argues that women’s experiences vary according to their social locations and all women are not empowered or dis-empowered in a similar fashion by the same gender system. While globalisation has led to increased opportunities for women physicians, their careers and contributions continue to be restricted by the specific gender structures and ideologies that govern women’s lives in the respective local and global sites."

    "abstract": "Asia’s historical contacts with the Gulf region date back to ancient times. Many historians have documented the existence of Indian settlements and merchant guilds in Aden and other prominent Gulf ports prior to the discovery of oil in the region (Secombe and Lawless 1986). In the beginning of the nineteenth century, the industrialization process, pearl trading, Haj and the requirement of skilled workers in the ports had prompted the flow of Indian migrants to the Persian Gulf region. These included ordinary artisans, masons, technicians, clerks and administrative personnel during the colonial times, largely to support the British colonial apparatus in the region (Kumar 2016). The colonial rulers used ‘Indian subjects’ as treasured resources to sustain and operate critical ventures like communication, education, health, bureaucracy, postal services and so on. Later, in the 1930s major Western oil companies like Kuwait Oil Company (KOC) and Aramco Gulf Operations Company Limited and Petroleum Development Qatar (PDQ) employed a substantial number of labourers from the subcontinent and a recruiting office was established in Surat (Kumar 2016). Thus, by late 1950s, Indian and Pakistani migrant workers constituted the largest workforce in many Gulf countries particularly in Kuwait and Bahrain."

    "abstract": "Urban infrastructures can enable and embody multiple forms of violence against women; from the spectacular and immediate, to the slow, everyday and intimate. Disconnections and absences of infrastructure – such as water and sanitation, to public transport and toilets – fracture peripheries and low-income neighbourhoods from resources, rights and mobility within the city, and in everyday life, enacting some of the largest tolls on women. This 'infrastructural violence' (Rodgers and O’Neill, 2012) is experienced in intimate ways by women in low-income neighbourhoods. While they lack access to adequate resources in urban settlements they simultaneously face all forms of physical violence during access to and use of water, toilets, public transport, energy use and walkways. \n\nDrawing from empirical fieldwork in the city of Thiruvanathapuram, Kerala, in southern India, we adopt an expanded notion of infrastructure that is mutually constitututive of gender-based relations of power and violence from the home to the city. \n\nDeveloping the rubrics of gendered safety and urban violence, we argue first, that lack of access to infrastructure is a form of intimate violence and second, that this violence is experienced and constituted through multiple scales, forms, sites and temporalities of infrastructural absence. In doing so, we further contribute to the extension of debates in feminist critical geography to critique binary constructions of gender based violence, by collapsing hierarchies of intimate and structural violence as the violence of infrastructure."

Professionalising volunteers through task-shifting results in the transformation of their philosophy of community care, which constrains and narrows understandings of mental health care. The state, in alliance with psychiatric NGOs, front-stages development through aggressive task-shifting which we argue is a socio-politico-moral process, disrupting the shared consciousness between volunteers and their own communities with fatal consequences for their most vulnerable citizens."

Indian archival laws pertain to public records alone, leaving out responsibility for the acquisition and preservation of historical records. Consequently, in India, the phrase “archival records” has come to mean public records more than 30 years old; there is no clarity as to what “historical records” are, nor guidance on how they should be preserved. Indian archival laws maintain a colonial understanding of the archive, wherein the function of the archive is to tame history in service of the state rather than preserve history outright. \n\nTaming the nation’s history in state archives silences the multiplicity of voices about Indian federation and presents particular difficulties when writing regional histories."

Early communists used rural libraries and reading rooms, tea-shops, public grounds and wall-art to engage with and communicate communism to the masses. \n\nWhat can the efforts of the early communists in Kerala tell us about the potential for communicative socialism? How can we adapt these experiences in the 21st century? Using autobiographies, memoirs, and personal interviews, this paper addresses these questions."

Recent policy measures by the Indian government have made the legal route of mobility for women much more difficult. Legal barriers speak directly to dominant patriarchal and nationalist logics that represent control over women’s bodies as normative. Being poor and unorganised, emigrant domestic workers have little voice in public policy debates that concerns them. \n\nThis chapter argues that intensification of controls in the recent past alongside tacit accommodation of irregular mobility has given impetus to clandestine recruitment practices and has served to criminalise women while providing impunity to unauthorised recruiters."

Spousal care-givers derived reciprocal motives and mutual care obligations through the institution of marriage. Adult children recognised filial duties and responsibilities and were in principle prepared to provide care to their parents. \n\nReciprocating the support received and the likelihood of intergenerational transfers motivated care exchanges from adult children to their older parents. Daughters-in-law executed transferred filial roles from their emigrant husbands and bore a larger burden of care. Primary adult care-givers relied on the ‘demonstration effect’, hoping that children observe the care-giving process and emulate it later. Imbalances and non-reciprocity in the care exchange led to frustrations and threatened the care relationships."

During the course of jurisdictional disputes, a variety of interested players - British politicians, colonial officials, international lawyers, rulers and advisors of princely states - engaged in debates over the idea of sovereignty to resolve questions of legal status, the extent of rights and powers, and to construct a political order that supported their interests and aspirations. \n\nI focus on legal texts written by British international lawyers and colonial officials as well as material relating to two jurisdictional disputes (one between the state of Travancore and the British Government and another between the state of Baroda and the British Government) to trace two versions of sovereignty that were articulated in late 19th-century South Asia - unitary and divisible. \n\nIn doing so, I argue that international law, and the doctrine of sovereignty in particular, became the shared language for participants to debate political problems and a key forum for the negotiation of political power."

    "abstract": "This article contrasts two seminal Malayalam films from the 1980s to understand the fraught relations between the Left politics and cinema in Kerala. \n\nThe first part of the article argues that <i>Mukhamukham</i> (Face to face, 1984) is a film in which its auteur director Adoor Gopalakrishnan identifies the Left political discourse and the medium of cinema as two powerful-popular epistemic tools at disposal in the region, but ultimately elevating cinema & resources as superior in taking us closer to truth.\n\nIn the second part, I look at John Abraham's iconic <i>Amma Ariyan</i> (Report to mother, 1986), to argue that the film came to be accepted widely and undisputedly as a political film mainly due to its (symbolic) privileging of the energies of collective affect – inalienable to both the Left politics and cinema – over contemplation and endevours of distanced intellectual knowledge production."

    "abstract": "In this paper I wish to initiate an analysis of certain experiences of 19th- and 20th-century Kerala particularly in the context of the Protestant missionary Christianity and its interface with Dalits to think through the ways in which a new public sphere emerged creating possibilities for the articulation of new ideas and perspectives of life that could be broadly referred to as social imaginaries, following, Charles Taylor. \n\nSuch new social imaginaries were significant in their defining of a possible good life that had a decisive effect on the lives of the slave castes in the succeeding decades. Articulated in everyday context of the exclusive congregations of slaves, the new ideas represented in the Bible became a powerful resource for the oppressed castes. The slave castes began to use the ideas derived from the Bible to organise their everyday life and their congregational gatherings created a public space which was not available to them in their past. Additionally, with the gradual spread of literacy they began to read the scriptures and subsequently print their own texts although that happened only in the 20th century. In fact, such endeavours created an oppositional subaltern counterpublics in Kerala."

    "abstract": "The 1930s and 1940s were a period when the reform-centric language of Malayalam literature came under blistering attack from a group of authors who initiated a movement called Jeevatsahithyam – meaning literature close to life. This signified a new momentum in the career of modern Malayalam literature in Keralam in the southern part of India with social realism being introduced as a mode of challenging erstwhile trends. \n\nJeevatsahithyam heralded a novel attempt to eliminate the distance between literature and social realities. Its authors deliberately opposed the hegemony of reform language in literature – a product of the late 19th century and early 20th century reform movement. According to them, the language of the reform movement which continued to dominate Malayalam literature was clearly embedded in a vicious circuit consisting of caste, class, and morality. This, as it was commonly argued, was a stumbling block in the realistic representation of social realities in the realm of literature. Jeevatsahithyam was renamed in 1944 as Purogamana Sahithya Sangham (Progressive Literature Society – from here on PLS) (Chandrasekharan 1999; Kumaramkandath 2013). Openly declaring itself against the established morals operating then, its ideological base, however, had to be justified by incorporating the term ‘progress’ (purogamanam) in its title. Thus, in a larger sense, it signified progressive realism rather than simply social realism.This chapter attempts to delve inside the debates around social realism in Malayalam literature where an ideological battle was staged in the regional public sphere around the questions of, broadly put, aesthetics and morality. It maps the discursive sequences of textual practices from the 1940s to the early 1970s when the depiction of desire in literature was a point of heated debates. \n\nI concentrate more on the early debates, particularly in the 1940s and early 1950s because they literally mediated between the rising social (progressive) realism's transgressive writings and the erstwhile reform concerns of ‘engendering’ disciplined subjects. As a cultural era, the mid-20th century was deeply embedded in the old reform discourses of sexual discipline and the postcolonial euphoria of political freedom. The ensuing concerns over building the nation had a profound impact on the patterns of imagining the sexual in literature."

    "abstract": "The publication of two autobiographies by Nalini Jameela was one of the key events that signalled the arrival of a new mode of configuring the sex worker in India. She published her first autobiography in 2005 and a second version after a gap of six months. \n\nThis iconoclastic move of a sex worker to take on the status of an author and demand respect for her profession made her dual autobiographies the centre of media attention. While distancing myself from the rousing reception of Jameela's self-writings as a radical move and its denouncements by its detractors, I argue that these narratives of selfcomposition point to how a marginalised subject not only has to engage with the public discourse but also critique it in order to give an account of the self. \n\nThe reader can track the incomplete and fraught trajectories of the sex worker claiming political subjectivity through an engagement with Jameela's narratives. I analyse the state discourse on the sex worker, especially within HIV/AIDS interventions, and its relationship to the sex worker's struggle to claim a political subject position. Through a close study of the formal and thematic experiments staged through Jameela's self-narratives, I will analyse how the sex worker uses cultural practices in order to ‘claim the day’.\n\n<i>Oru Laingika Thozhilaliyude Atmakatha</i> (The Autobiography of a Sex Worker) by Nalini Jameela was published in June 2005 by DC Books, one of the largest publishing firms in Kerala. It was advertised as the first autobiography of a sex worker in Kerala. The first book came out in six editions in one hundred days, and Jameela became well known in Kerala because of the debates on the controversial book in print and visual media. Media reports labelled Nalini Jameela's book as a candid, defiant document of ‘the life of the silenced’. The book was packaged as a ‘burning, spinechilling’ exposé of the life of a sex worker. It garnered massive attention and debate in the regional, national, and international media. The book publicity also focused on how Jameela deviated from the familiar profile of the ‘author’ because of her underprivileged caste, class, and professional status. She grew up with limited means in a working-class family of the non-dominant Ezhava caste."

    "abstract": "Serpent-god worship is an ancient tradition still practised in many sacred groves across the Western Ghats of India. Although sacred groves there hold ecological conservation value, few studies have focused on arguably the most iconic taxon in the region, snakes. \n\nWe thus investigated the impact of sacred groves and snake deity worshipping on attitudes towards snakes by conducting surveys with people who had entered sacred groves in the past. \n\nWe found that very few participants who had encountered snakes inside sacred groves in the past harmed them during these encounters. However, nearly a quarter of all participants do harm snakes if encountered outside sacred groves. We also found that a larger proportion of participants who do not harm snakes outside sacred groves worship snake deities, relative to those that do harm them. \n\nOur work thus highlights the influence of sacred groves and snake deity worshipping on pacifistic human–snake relations in Southwestern India."

    "abstract": "The widespread marginalisation of heritage languages in public and political discourse coupled with the association of proficiency in host languages with personal and professional gain have led many diasporic communities to shy away from transmitting their heritage languages at home: a context considered to be optimal for minority language maintenance. This does not imply however that attempts-on the part of migrants-to keep alive their heritage languages, are non-existent.\n\nDemonstrating a harmonious convergence between their everyday language practices and the above-mentioned assumption that the home is a ‘stronghold' for heritage language use are a Malayali community based in Yorkshire, England. Making this a possibility was their commitment towards maintaining certain cultural practices and values associated with the first-generation migrants' country of origin, India. \n\nDrawing on semi-structured interview responses, observational field notes, and audio-recorded family conversations obtained from this community, what I thus propose in this paper is that these cultural values and practices form the pillars that support the Malayalis’ attempts to preserve their heritage language Malayalam. Furthermore, my findings suggest the agents behind these endeavours to pan across three generations, in two countries: the UK and India."

Its Indian Ocean connectivity, long before European explorers arrived at the Malabar Coast, had made significant impact on the maritime trade in the Indian Ocean region. China’s expedition to the Southern Asia was aimed to expand the benevolence of Chinese emperor and to establish its suzerainty in maritime trade rather than to establish the permanent position on land. The political dynamics at home caused the rise and fall of the maritime might of China. The famous explorer, Zheng He’s expeditions represented China’s ambition to expand its control over the Indian Ocean regions. The Malabar Coast with its geographical advantages had developed maritime activities enhancing its commercial fortunes. China had to accept the strength of Malabar kingdoms in terms of political power, trade and commercial advantages. Importantly, Malabar kingdoms did not accept the Chinese assertions of supremacy but engaged with the Chinese on equal terms. \n\nAn attempt is made here to trace China’s maritime strategy to expand their power beyond the immediate periphery and establish its supremacy in the Indian Ocean."

    "abstract": "The port of Cochin on the Malabar Coast of India had always been a centre of shipbuilding. After the Dutch conquest in the port in 1663, the Dutch East India Company (VOC), too, established a shipyard there. At this yard, the VOC experimented with building ocean-going ships until the management of the company decreed that these were to be built solely in the Dutch Republic itself. \n\nDuring the first half of the eighteenth century, the yard focused on the repair of passing Indiamen and the construction of smaller vessels for use in and between the VOC commands in Malabar, Coromandel, Bengal and Sri Lanka. For most of the vessels built during the 1720s and 1730s, detailed accounts exist, allowing for a reconstruction of the costs of the various shipbuilding materials in Malabar, as well as the relative cost of labour. \n\nFrom the 1750s onwards, operations at the yard again become more difficult to discern. Likely, the relative decline of the VOC’s presence in Malabar caused a reduction in operations at the yard, but the shipyard was still in existence when Cochin was captured by British forces in 1795. However, this did not mean the end of Cochin as a shipbuilding centre, as a number or Royal Navy frigates were built at Cochin during the early nineteenth century."

Revisiting the concept in the light of Muslim historical experiences of naturalization in non-Muslim political settings will provide aspects of naturalization of Muslims that are contrary to the anti-immigrant narratives aired in the West. \n\nContrary to the conventional binary of <em>Dār al-Kufr</em> and <em>Dār al-Islām</em> usually drawn in the scholarly debates on nationalist identities within Islamic ethics, this chapter contextualizes the amicable livelihood that Arab immigrants nurtured in the peripheries such as the Indian Ocean for understanding citizenship and naturalization process in non-Muslim lands. The historical anecdotes in this chapter not only present a more dynamic ethical dimension of migratory settlement of Muslim immigrants in Islamic history but also expose the significance of contexts in understanding Islamic ethics that helps to dismantle anti-immigrant bigotries."

Using appropriate statistical tests, we derived predictors of severe disease and computed a risk score model.\n\nOf the 153 patients (mean age 50±17 y; 64% males), 31 (20%) had severe dengue and 4 (3%) died. Petechial lesions, hypoalbuminemia (&lt;3.5 g/dl), elevated alanine aminotransferase (&gt;40 IU/l) and urea &gt;40 IU/l were significant predictors. Our scoring system (cut-off: 2) showed excellent performance, with an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.9741, sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 96% and accuracy of 98%. The risk score was secondarily validated on 48 patients hospitalized from March 2019 to June 2019.\n\nOur scoring system is easy to implement and will help primary healthcare practitioners in promptly identifying severe dengue cases upon hospital presentation."

This conflict, she shows, defies explanations centering religious, caste, or ideological differences. It offers instead new ways of understanding how quotidian political competition can produce antagonistic majoritarian communities. Rival political parties mobilise practices of disbursing care and aggressive masculinity in their struggle for electoral and popular power, a process intensified by a criminal justice system that reproduces rather than mitigates violence. \n\nChaturvedi traces these dynamics from the late colonial period to the early 2000s, illuminating the broader relationships between democratic life, divisiveness, and majoritarianism."

The problem of nurse shortage has been aggravated by the COVID pandemic. The young age at which the Indian nurses migrate, suggests that the decision to work overseas is made probably at the time of pursuing the studies or probably one pursues nursing because it opens the opportunity for working overseas.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the intentions of nursing students to pursue overseas career on completion of their studies. The study used a cross-sectional survey design to collect data from 1,408 nursing students from across four states of India namely, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra and Rajasthan using a Google survey form. \n\nThe major finding of the study was that 54% of the respondents intended to migrate overseas. Better career advancement opportunities, better working conditions, higher pay, better lifestyle, were the reasons cited by those who had an intension to migrate. Establishing norms for nurse-patient ratios, and scope of work along with pay scales for nurses with various qualifications and experience could be the most strategic moves that the policy makers can consider to control brain drain in nursing and control nurse migration."

However, scholars of transnational family life have argued that some kinds of care are possible at a distance with the help of digital technologies. \n\nThis chapter explores how nurses from the South Indian state of Kerala, who migrate abroad for work, integrate mobile phones, smartphones, and webcams into caring for their ageing parents at a distance by forming ‘transnational care collectives’. \n\nWithin these collectives, care is enacted through practices such as frequent calling and telemonitoring. Through such practices, people and technologies co-create new norms of good elder care and filial duties, which transforms kinship and gender dynamics. The chapter concludes with several recommendations for policy, including stimulating new discourses of international labour migration and improving digital infrastructure and literacy to support transnational care collectives."

    "abstract": "Kerala’s social sphere is well-stocked with the elements of modernity like literacy, democracy, equality and fraternity, which makes it difficult to identify and classify casteism and its effects. The projected image of modernity makes Kerala’s public sphere more accessible and permissible to minority groups when compared to other states. The state’s emergence after independence manifests through its learning and employment institutions. These motifs of development camouflage the existing casteism present in the state, thus making it invisible. Here, Dalit literature becomes pivotal as it becomes a storehouse of implicit caste references and stereotyping, which the statistics often fail to see. The article puts into perspective two Dalit short stories, ‘Mea Culpa’ and ‘Karthik Immanuel’s Spiritual Musings’ written by Raju K. Vasu and Prince Aymenem, respectively. They represent a public sphere where no explicit casteism occurs, whereas its repercussions are nevertheless felt. The stories showcase how micro-level manifestations of casteism occur, which are neither identified nor quantified. Taking the concept of microaggression proposed by Psychologist Derald Wing Sue, the research attempts to do a narrative analysis of the primary texts, delving deep into the invisible but pervading casteism."

Writing in a regional Indian language and for a Malayalam readership about the political and social dilemmas of an Arab city, Benyamin constructs a transnational multilingual space where writing and translation enable dissent and where individuals from different national and linguistic backgrounds have a stake in political change and its repercussions."

Compared with those who have no migration experience, the attitudes of returning migrants from Saudi Arabia toward gender-based violence were more conservative by three standard deviations, while the attitudes of those returning from the Gulf were less conservative by 0.5 standard deviation. Similarly, compared with those with no migration experience, returning migrants from Saudi Arabia were more conservative by 2.6 standard deviations regarding extreme attitudes related to gender norms, such as sexual assault, while those returning from the Gulf were less conservative by 0.7 standard deviation. \n\nThese results show that migration experience can have a substantial impact on the gender attitudes of returning migrants, with potential implications for migration and gender policies in Kerala and for countries that send a large share of temporary migrants overseas for work."

    "abstract": "On 28 September 2018, the Supreme Court (SC) of India struck down the prohibition of women of menstruating ages in the forest-shrine of Sabarimala in Kerala as gender discrimination and a variant of untouchability. Subsequently, brahmin and kshatriya temple authorities, the sudra community organisation known as the Nair Service Society (NSS) and the Sangh Parivar organisations organised protests against the judgment. However, much before the SC verdict even as the matter was in court, in 2016, a group of Malayali women had already created a high-decibel campaign on social media called #ReadyToWait (RTW), which announced their determination to preserve the custom at Sabarimala that disallowed women of menstruating ages as pilgrims. Their campaign proved so successful that this prohibition of women of menstruating ages in Sabarimala began to stand for Hinduism in general; soon, the denial of the former was perceived as tantamount to the rejection of the latter. The campaign grew even more powerful in the days following the verdict and was important in bringing many educated and upper- or middle-class women with no direct exposure to Hindutva ideology closer to politics focused on ‘Hindu interests’. The confrontation between the Kerala government led by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPM) and the forces of caste privilege and Hindutva in Kerala deeply polarised civil society; the confrontation was marked by several incidents of violence (Roopesh 2018).Through this examination of the RTW discourse, I hope to address the relative absence of Malayali women in the burgeoning literature on women in conservative Hindutva formations. There are a few studies on the growing public religiosity and piety of Hindu women in Kerala. But for the most, Malayali women are viewed within the frame of social development in social science and historical literature in twentieth-century Kerala. In the debate about the achievement of remarkable social development in Kerala despite the state's poor economic growth in the twentieth century (commonly referred to as the ‘Kerala Model’ debate), women figured mainly as positive, rational, domestic agents of change who benefited unequivocally from the social transformation of the twentieth century."

This is despite noteworthy environmental conservation movements and civil society organisations committed to the cause of the environment. Although the country has an array of competent environmental regulations, the environmental sustainability of the development programmes remains the least addressed. \n\nThe case is not different for Kerala state, despite its high literacy and human development matching many developed countries. The “Kerala Development Model” has been highly praised for its high-level social development. The apparently well-informed population of the state also outscores most states regarding environmental identity. \n\nIn this context, this paper explores the Athirappilly hydroelectric project pursued by the Kerala State Electricity Board Limited and other interest groups. \n\nIt appears that the contemporary socio-economic-political scenario is urging the state's highly literate and politicised public to a post-nature or post-truth society increasingly engrossed in a consumerist lifestyle at the cost of the unique environmental setup. \n\nThe present study also highlights how the Kerala population, once dominated by socialistic/liberal ideologies with egalitarian values, has been riding the neoliberal development wave giving little importance to nature and long-term ecological security."

The abundance of microplastics ranged from 15.13 ± 4.13 – 170 ± 17.75 particles L−1 (mean: 55.81 ± 34 particles L−1). A maximum number of microplastics were obtained from site C3 and the least from site C8. The weight distribution of microplastic on sites exhibited strong positive correlation with the abundance (r = 0.83). Microplastics of size <20 µm were in higher abundance in the study area. Microscopic examination revealed fragments (47.06%) as predominant plastics and the dominant colour was brown/mud (26.99%). \n\nAbundance of coloured plastics indicated the probability of damage to aquatic life. Raman spectrum analysis revealed that Low-Density Poly Ethylene (40%) as the predominant polymer that could be observed at all the sampling sites. Lower-sized microplastics would cause accidental ingestion by organisms. \n\nThe estimated release of a higher average number of microplastic particles (55.81 ± 4.25) into the marine environment is of serious concern. The observed overall abundance and recovery rate of microplastics in the study area indicated the status of contamination due to a multitude of sources."

In the context of the global pandemic, there is a lack of online mental health interventions for parental IPV victims. \n\nThis study examined the efficacy of the Cognitive Self Compassion (CSC) Online Intervention to enhance the self-esteem of adolescents exposed to parental IPV. The present study employed Conklin’s programme development model, which involves three phases: (1) planning, (2) design and implementation, and (3) evaluation and programme validation. \n\nThe participants were adolescents (N = 192, 11-17 years of age) from India, Kerala and they were randomly assigned to experimental (n-20) and control group (n = 20). Coopersmith self-esteem scale, interview, and focus group discussion was used to assess the severity of the problem. \n\nThe significant change in post-test scores between the experimental and control groups (Ctrl: M = 14.95, SD = 1.73; Exp: M = 37.20, SD = 1.85) and the Pretest and post- test scores of the experimental group (Pretest: M = 15.60, SD = 1.90; Posttest = 37.20, SD = 1.85) indicates that the eight modular programs of CSC online intervention programme effectively improve self-esteem in adolescents exposed to IPV and the effect sizes at post treatment were large (d.12.42).\n\nThe study provided ample indication of the efficacy of the Cognitive Self Compassion online intervention program to enhance the self-esteem of adolescents"

    "abstract": "Remarkable feats of the past often leave behind historical pointers leaving us mesmerised. One such episode is that of the establishment of a magnetic and meteorological observatory on the peak of the Agasthiyar mountain 6200 feet above the sea level on the western Ghats in the year 1855 by John Allan Broun under the princely state of Travancore. It had facilities far ahead of its times representing the commitment to scientific universalism by its patrons. Broun established the observatory on the Agasthiyar mountain peak and undertook a meticulous study overcoming daunting geographical constrains. Broun was awarded the Keith Medal from the Royal Society of Edinburgh for the period 1859–1861. He received the Royal Medal from the Royal Society of London in 1878. He passed away in 1879. Remnants of the magnetic observatory which earned Broun scientific acclaim remain undiscovered, clouded within the Agasthiyar mountains."

    "abstract": "Tribal populations, in general, are generally lagging behind in social-economic spheres of lives as they are at different stages of social and economic development compared to the remaining population. Health and nutritional inequities are higher among tribal population in our country. Poor relationship with environment, undernutrition and newly acquired lifestyle factors makes them very vulnerable compared to the general population. The review exercise showed that nutritional status and factors associated with geographical variations were not studied especially among the particularly vulnerable tribal groups in Kerala. Hence, this study was conducted to develop the bio profile of Kattunayakan tribes in Kerala and associate their nutritional status with several factors along with their health-seeking behaviors. \n\nThe study followed a community-based cross-sectional approach using a mixed method, which is both qualitative and quantitative in nature. The field survey was conducted in Wayanad district in Kerala where more than 85% of the Kattunayakans’ population lives. The sample size is calculated as 238. The Kattunayakan community has always been deprived of creche and basic facilities, which has forced them to remain underdeveloped in most aspects of life. \n\nThe findings of this study have shown a steady social and nutritional transition among the tribes. The determinants that affect the nutrition status most are education, occupation, income, housing conditions and lifestyle. \n\nAn overall improvement in the quality of life by improving determinants like education, occupation and access to health care is suggested to improve the nutritional status and health indicators of the community."

    "abstract": "This chapter surveys Indian Gulf writing, focusing on novels and memoirs in Malayalam and English. The themes discussed are precarity, privation, and humiliation; gender and sexuality; political criticism; and racism. With reference to the Malayalam literary sphere in particular, the chapter demonstrates that migrant literature needs to be studied by taking into account its positionality within the regional field of literary production. Indian Gulf Writing is an area of study with far-reaching implications in fields such as migration literature, petrofiction, and diaspora literature, even as it also offers anthropological insight into the conditions of migrants living in the Persian Gulf."

From tapioca and fish curry served on a leaf platter; cold rice and mango pickle served in an earthen pot; black coffee with jaggery served in a porcelain cup; fish wrapped in a banana leaf and barbequed in firewood; the Malayalee shifted his palate to the taste of the neighbouring state's idli, sambhar and vada; to the North Indian dishes, Mughalai dishes, continental, and inter-continental dishes served in steel plates to Chinese porcelain to western crockery. But after savouring dishes pan world, the typical Malayalee is back in search of his roots. This paper aims to delineate that search and identify the various traditional dishes now understood to be healthy, and tasty and anchoring the community to the roots of food culture. This study involves an in-depth observation and analysis of food culture, identity, heritage, cooking techniques and ingredients used. The change in the culinary aspects of a typical Malayalee's life is understood and his search back to his roots is portrayed through this article. Therefore, this study highlights the gastronomical journey of the Malayalee to the traditional roots of Kerala cuisine in the modern age of globalization. The Valorisation of established classic dishes from the margins to the table top of the finest restaurants is also analysed."

    "abstract": "The study investigates the impact of flooding on mental health and resilience among adolescent students in Kerala. It explores the interrelationships between the impact generated by floods, depression, anxiety, stress, and resilience among adolescent students. \n\nTwo groups of fifty adolescent students each, from within the age range of twelve to eighteen years, were selected for the study. The first group had experienced floods and their devastation first-hand, while the second group were yet to experience floods or their devastation. The study compares the variables pertaining to both sets of respondents and identifies potential areas of psychological impact. A convergent mixed-method research design was employed to achieve these objectives, and self-report questionnaires and in-depth interviews were used for data collection. \n\nThe key findings reveal that flood-affected adolescents score higher in metrics like impact of events, depression, anxiety, and stress, whereas their counterparts who are not affected by floods display higher resilience. Thematic analysis identified significant themes, including livelihood challenges, problems related to schooling, an apprehension surrounding potential flooding, and a lack of knowledge about and preparedness for disasters, while a surprisingly positive theme could be discerned when it came to the outlook of the respondents regarding coping with the outcomes. \n\nThe results underscore the need for new policies to mitigate the psychological impact of disasters on adolescents, emphasising the importance of providing psychological support services and preparedness training."

Results indicated a seven-fold increase in its mean concentration (7.14 ± 3.03 items/m3) post deluge. The average abundance was highest during pre-monsoon (8.27 ± 3.09 items/m3). Fibres were the dominant group, with blue and black being the most prevalent colours. Polyethylene and polypropylene were the most commonly found polymers, possibly gaining entry through sewage waste or land-based plastic litter. Highest abundance of microplastic was recorded off Kochi categorising it at Hazard Level I under Pollution Load Index assessment. Similarly high levels of Pollution Hazard Index and Potential Ecological Risk Index were also reported due to the presence of hazardous polymers PVC and PU that can cause concern to marine life. The differential weathering pattern and surface morphology analysis suggested microplastics to be relatively old that had undergone substantial mechanical and oxidative weathering."

This study attempts to identify pathways that interact between the physical and social environment and leisure-time physical activity and identify gender differences in these pathways.\nMethods\nA survey was conducted in the Kottayam district of Kerala in India from July 2018–December 2019 to examine direct and indirect pathways of various factors that impact leisure-time physical activity. 467 adults in the age group of 18–65 years, was enquired about various individual and environmental factors that affect their physical activity levels. Structural equation modeling was employed to test the relationship among different variables.\nResults\nThe study found that there was a significant indirect effect of intrapersonal and environmental influences in the pathways that affected leisure-time physical activity. Among men, there was a significant association between self-efficacy and motivation and environmental influences (environmental factors, p = 0.019; body-related motivation p = 0.012, motivation for social motives reasons, p = 0.005); however, among women, environmental factors influence only through extrinsic motives related to body image and appearance (environmental factors, p = 0.009, motivation for appearance, p = 0.05).\nConclusion\nThe study concludes that although intrapersonal factors like self-efficacy and extrinsic motives like health and fitness are salient predictors of physical activity, environmental factors play a supportive role in enhancing engagement in leisure time activity. Future interventions should be tailored to meet gender-specific interests to promote regular physical activity among adults."

    "abstract": "‘Representations’ of recovery refer to the creation, circulation, reinforcement and subversion of ideas about what should be done in the months and years after a hazard has struck. The research reported in this paper outlines how contrasting and, in some cases, openly contested narratives can emerge in society around the nature and causes of the event, the impacts and needs of the affected population, and the priorities and effectiveness of recovery processes. We worked in three states in India – Odisha, Tamil Nadu and Kerala – collecting and collating a range of information on ideas, experiences and debates about disaster recovery from people in disaster-affected communities, from governmental and non-governmental organisations, from reports in the media, from academic studies and from official documentation. These related to major hazard events over the last two decades as well as recent events that hit the states prior to or during the course of the research. Though there is much variation between disaster cases in the pattern of representations by different actors, there are some discernible elements that do tend to work together to generate an effect on outcomes, often in ways that not only side-line livelihood and wellbeing priorities of disaster-affected people but also sometimes downplay or even negate the needs and rights of specific social groups. Managing disaster recovery is a hugely challenging task. However, it is not well served if the ways in which impacts and recovery needs are articulated lead to the effective exclusion of certain sectors, social groups, needs and concerns from full consideration, or to the blocking of alternative perspectives such as proactive approaches to future risk reduction. Key in this, we maintain, is the need to shift representations of recovery to better match the needs and voices of those most affected."

It then discusses two crucial textual sources, the Periplous of the Erythreian Sea and the Muziris Papyrus, before sketching what is known of the changing scale of trade across the first millennium and surveying other textual and material evidence for these trade routes. The importance of the monsoon winds in shaping trade and cultural life at Indian and Red Sea ports addresses issues such as diet and technological transfer. Finally, the changing historiography of Red Sea–Indian trade is outlined, emphasizing the increasing move away from ascribing primary agency and significance to Roman actors."

    "abstract": "Mass disease and starvation in the princely state of Travancore during the Second World War claimed some 90,000 lives. However, this episode has never received much prominence, especially when compared to the simultaneous crisis in Bengal. It is, in many ways, forgotten. Instead, Travancore’s wartime food management apparatus appears in some accounts as a success story. How did this happen? \n\nIntegration into the world economy, the reordering of a rigid social structure, and popular political pressures on an autocratic princely regime created a unique set of conditions that left Travancore vulnerable to food scarcity and conflict during the Second World War. A particularly draconian princely regime that suppressed civil liberties prevented the gravity of the situation from being understood. This culminated in vastly unequal suffering and disease-related deaths. \n\nBut the story is not merely one of despair. The Indian communists took advantage of war conditions to bring together agricultural and factory labourers and contribute to improving the food situation in this ‘People’s War’, while mainstream nationalists sought to obstruct the war effort and have the British ‘quit’ India. Wartime activities would shape the unique post-colonial politics of what became the state of Kerala in 1956. \n\nIntervening at the intersection of the historiographies of food and the princely states, this article adds a regional perspective to the nation-centric social history of the Second World War in South Asia. Hunger was a constitutive experience of this period across various parts of India, but the post-colonial political legacies of war could be regionally distinct."

Uncertainties arising from different stages in the modelling process of extremes contribute to the overall uncertainty in the final estimates. In this study, some important sources of uncertainties that occur in the modelling chain for projection of future extremes are analysed. \n\nThe contribution of climate models, hydrological models, representative concentration pathways (RCPs) and the parameters of the extreme value distribution to the overall uncertainty in the streamflow return levels of the Chaliyar river basin in Kerala, India, was quantified using analysis of variance. 5, 10, 25, and 50-year return levels for the near (2021–2050) and far (2070–2099) future periods were computed. \n\nResults of the study indicate that the median values of return levels for the near (0.6–13.5%) and far (21.5–37.3%) future periods are higher than the corresponding values for the observed data. Also the uncertainty ranges of the return levels in the near (2–2.4 times) and far (3–3.7 times) future for different return periods are higher compared to that of the observed. The contribution to uncertainties in the return levels from climate models, parameters of the extreme value distribution employed and hydrological models is higher than that from the RCPs. The contribution of parameter uncertainty increases with the return period and that of the climate models reduces with the return period for the two future periods considered in this study, indicating that parameter uncertainty is an important source of uncertainty and has to be considered while predicting the future extremes. The contribution to uncertainty by the hydrological models and by the RCPs does not exhibit much variation for different return periods in both the future time periods considered. \n\nUnderstanding the uncertainties in future extremes would help to devise proper adaptation strategies to mitigate the probable impacts of climate change."

    "abstract": "The rapid changes in the living conditions due to accelerated urbanization and changes in climatic and geographic circumstances led the world to experience 7348 disaster events between 2000 and 2019, which is 75% more than the disaster events reported between 1980 and 1999 as per UN Office of Disaster Risk Reduction Study (Human Cost of Disasters 2000–2019—Geography and You, 2020). Children are vital resources of a country, and are one of the most vulnerable groups in India; thus, emphasis on issues affecting the safety and health of children becomes crucial. Schooling takes up about thirteen to fifteen years in a child's life, making school preparedness an indispensable responsibility of the nation. School safety is the creation of safe environments for children starting from their homes to their schools and back (National Disaster Management Guidelines—School Policy, 2016). Kerala witnessed an upsurge in massive catastrophes in the recent past. This study, thus, sets the focus in Kerala schools to examine the existing management steps, policies, and methods taken, at present, for preparedness, considering the disaster vulnerability of the state. The paper understands the potential hazards—such as earthquakes and other natural disasters, floods, cyclones, fire, pandemics, accidents—structural and nonstructural, and analyses the current preparedness mechanisms in schools. By evaluating, the research propounds a suggestive working strategy at managerial, planning, and operational levels, which can maintain preparedness in schools with periodic audits, documentation, verification, monitoring, and revision. In substance, this research critically explicates the preparedness of schools in Kerala in handling a disaster and works out strategies to combat any instance of disaster for safer school environments in Kerala."

    "abstract": "This book engages with this dynamic period [post-1990s] from a refreshingly different perspective through an imaginative assemblage of materials straddling diverse disciplines and layers of social lives. An elaborate introduction embeds the book in the complex layers of the social history of Kerala, where divergent narratives vie for an interpretive upper hand. \n\nIn a deft fusion of the personal and historical, Mokkil lays bare the inadequacy of a transnational metropolitan discourse and critical categories to address and comprehend the regional, local and vernacular. The book is a sensitive attempt to retrieve the feel of experiences which cannot be explained away by tropes and categories honed within the smithy of Eurocentric critical thought."

Seattle: University of Washington Press, 2019. 288 pp. ISBN: 9780295745572 (cloth).\n\n(Extract) On the shifting terrain of contemporary Indian sexual politics, two opposing narratives often surface. On one hand is an account of linear progress from oppressive tradition to globalisation, modernity, and sexual freedom. On the other is an account of an idealised, precolonial, sexually tolerant past, suppressed by, and finally freed from, colonial morality.\n\nNavaneetha Mokkil’s subtle and wide-ranging book on sexuality in Kerala complicates narratives of 'a quick transition from silence to celebration' (6). Unruly Figures weaves a picture of a contradictory, uneven and volatile sexual terrain, of 'flickering movements that cannot be reified' (200). Mokkil makes a powerful argument for the region as a dynamic site for theorising sexuality and politics."

    "abstract": "To explore the importance of death and the dead to the study of religious conversion, this article adopts an ethnographic and comparative approach to the lives and deaths of two male Muslim converts in the southwest Indian state of Kerala. Paying attention to the treatment of their dead bodies, which were donated and cremated, contrary to their wishes for an Islamic funeral, and the problematisation of their proper names, it is argued that death is the point at which selves are made/remade. Death provides the opportunity for the dead, their kin, friends, and state institutions to make claims about religious identities and familial relations. I conclude that these multiple and often contradictory stances converted the dead into religiously indeterminate figures, though their belonging to their kin was successfully established."

    "abstract": "An interest in Jewish topographies involves looking at Jewish presence in locations that help relocalise Jewish space. In this article, we argue that the task of reading Jewish identity as a diaspora community calls for a location- and geography-specific response, especially in aesthetic discourses that unfold Jewish identity situated outside the Eurocentric contexts. Such location-specific readings can enable a “provincialising” of the West-centric construct of Jewish identity. \n\nWe argue that Malayalam author Sethu's novel <i>Aliyah: The Last Jew of the Village</i> is an interesting case in point. Set in the middle of the 20th century, the novel deals with the ways in which the Jews living near Cochin, an island-city in the southern province of Kerala in India, respond to the call for a ‘return’ to Israel. As the Jews and other communities respond to the developments around a possible return, the Jewish and non-Jewish characters in the novel all unpack a different discourse about how Jews belong to Cochin, a phenomenon that can be appreciated once one begins to understand that Jews, as a quintessential diaspora community, have had multiple histories of inhabiting geographies. \n\nForegrounding these locations, through provincialising, might offer possibilities of challenging stereotypes in literary critiques."

    "abstract": "The International Handbook on Creativity, a compendium of research occurring internationally into creativity, looks at the way creativity is perceived within various societies and cultures and places this alongside the scientific research about creativity. The historically generated discourses surrounding each culture's understanding of creativity can be counterposed to research-based ideas on creativity that are seeking something universal about creative human actions. If the latter positions are indeed seeking universal applications, then they should be able to be successfully applied to various cultures around the planet. The systems model of creativity has been empirically applied to contemporary Western popular music creative practices, but there appears to be little empirical application of these ideas to other music cultures, such as that of the music, song and dance cultures of India. This chapter presents results from a pilot study that is the first part of an investigation into the systems model of creativity as it is applied to non-European settings. To test the model's initial applicability in a non-Western setting, the authors undertook in-depth interviews with two music directors from Kerala, a city [sic] on the western seaboard of India, who had been studying sound technology courses at Leeds Metropolitan University in the UK before returning to India. The authors support this evidence with audio-visual recordings of creative action in the recording studios of Kerala. The results of this pilot study will feed into a much larger investigation into the creative practices of film music composition and recording in an Indian setting."

    "abstract": "The study focuses on the occurrence, abundance and characteristics of microplastics (MPs) in the subsurface and bottom waters of Vembanad Lake, a Ramsar site in the state of Kerala. \n\nEven though several studies elucidate the prevalence of microplastic pollution in the surface waters of aquatic ecosystems, a little is known about the vertical distribution of MPs in the water column. Vembanad Lake water is greatly affected by microplastic pollution compared to other Indian lakes as it receive discharges from six rivers; a number of sewage canals and run-off. \n\nUbiquitous distribution of MPs was found in the lake with a mean abundance of 26.79 ± 3.74 items L−1 and 52.70 ± 5.43 items L−1 in subsurface and bottom waters respectively. Fibers, constitute more than half of the total MPs in both subsurface and bottom waters. The dominance of polyamide and polypropylene with most of the MPs being fibers indicate that they originate probably from fishing activities and laundry wastewater. The particles with in the size range 100–500 μm were in excess in the water samples. \n\nFurther fragmentation, increasing the number of MPs in the lake water was envisaged from the SEM images of MPs showing cracks and crevices. These MPs along with adsorbed contaminants upon ingestion by the aquatic organisms become a threat to the food web of the lake. \n\nThe local population which depends mainly on the fishes and mussels of the lake for their dietary needs would be greatly affected by the contamination of the lake with MPs. Further research on MPs contamination in edible biota would give more insights on the extent and risks of MPs pollution in the lake."

    "abstract": "Conventional Flood Frequency Analysis (FFA) may underestimate flood quantiles and increase hydraulic infrastructure vulnerability in changing climates. This study uses annual maximum streamflow data from 17 hydrologic stations along west-flowing rivers in Kerala, India, for Non-Stationary (NS) FFA. The Generalized Extreme Value model with a linear temporal location parameter worked effectively for five stations. Kidangoor and Pattazhy stations must account for non-stationarity for longer return periods (RPs) (>50 years), whereas Neeleeswaram and Perumannu stations must for shorter RPs (<50 years). An extensive study was conducted for Neeleswaram station (Periyar basin) by simulating NS models incorporating four large-scale climate oscillations as covariates. The stationary assumption underestimated flood return levels of 2-year RP by about 61% which increases the flood risk leading to failure of hydraulic infrastructures. It was observed that the best fitted climate-based NS model achieves stationary return level of 150-years RP at 25-years RP itself. The study proved that the climate-based NS models captured the 2018 August Floods in Periyar basin better than stationary and time-based models. The regional variability in FF curve behaviour concludes that NSFFA for Kerala cannot be generalised and must be done at a local-scale."

They practised it to their advantage as it not only made it possible for them to get integrated into the existing Hindu cultural universe of the host nation but also conferred upon them a respectable social status, resulting in the acquisition of social/cultural capital. \n\nHowever, in Andhra, Christian and Jewish Madigas embraced their respective religions to eschew caste and gain self-respect. \n\nIn Kerala, while caste became an effective route for a harmonious integration into the cultural matrix of the host territory, it not only disrupted intra-communal amity both among the Cochin Jews and the Kerala Christians but also became a source of defiance and alienation from the core teachings of each of these religions, resulting in the loss of ‘spiritual capital’. \n\nOn the contrary, the rejection of caste on the part of the Madiga Jews and Madiga Christians, perhaps, brought them closer to the central message of fraternity and equality found both in Judaism and in Christianity, whereby they fared better in ‘spiritual and religious capitals’ than their counterparts in Kerala."

    "abstract": "In 2017, the State of Kerala in India, launched the ‘Aardram’ mission for health. One of the aims of the mission was to enhance the Primary Health Care (PHC) provisioning in the state through the Family Health Centre (FHC) initiative. This was envisaged through a Comprehensive PHC approach that prioritised preventive, promotive, curative, rehabilitative and palliative services, and social determinants of health. \n\nGiven this backdrop, the study aimed to examine the renewed policy commitment towards comprehensive PHC and the extent to which it remains true to the globally accepted ideals of PHC. This was undertaken using a Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) of the policy discourse on PHC. This included examining the policy documents related to FHC and Aardram as well as the narratives of policy-level actors on PHC and innovations for them. Through CDA we examined the discursive representation of PHC and innovations for improving them at the level of local governments in the state. \n\nThough the mission envisaged a shift from the influence of market-driven ideas of health, the analysis of the current policy discourse on primary healthcare suggested otherwise. The discourse continues to carry a curative care bias within its ideas of PHC. The disproportionate emphasis on strategies for early detection, treatment and infrastructural improvements meant limited space for dimensions like preventive, protective and promotive, thus digressing from the gatekeeping role of PHC. The subdued emphasis on preventive and promotive dimensions and depoliticisation of social determinants of health within a PHC discourse indicates that, in the long run, the mission stands to risk its stated goals of social justice and health equity envisioned in the FHC initiative."

    "abstract": "Abstract By the late nineteenth century, when printing press was popular across the world. In South Asia, there was increased production and dissemination of Tamil and Malayalam vernacular materials in Arabic script. This intermarriage of local languages with a cosmopolitan script was part of a larger trend of the time, and in South India those were advanced by Arabic-Malayalam and Arabic-Tamil literatures (also referred as Malabari and Arwī respectively). Hundreds of texts printed annually at the prime centres of Islamic printing on both Malabar and Coromandel coasts were circulated among mobile and immobile communities of the region across the Indian Ocean, Pacific and Atlantic littorals. The reach and impact of such vernacular printings are yet to be explored thoroughly, for these materials have been spread across several formal and informal collections and there has not been any systematic attempt to identify or catalogue them. In this article, I focus on uncatalogued Arabic-Malayalam materials at the British Library London on which I have been working on in the last few years. These materials from the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries help us understand the history of the region, religion and printing. After a brief historical overview, I focus on some major features, themes, trends, places, and people in about 150 texts I consulted, and which I discuss in relation to broader histories of Arabic-Malayalam tradition."

However, the early life migration experience and occupational hazards at the destination can lead to serious health problems later in life. \n\nThis study aims to understand the association between early life migration and the health and risky behaviour of elderly return migrants, using data from the Kerala Migration Survey in 2018. \n\nThe results of bivariate and multivariate analyses show that the majority of migrants return due to retirement and ill health at the average age of 51 and suffer from poor health and multiple diseases. More than half (55%) of elderly returnees reported poor health, and among them, 70% have at least one chronic disease. \n\nThe early life migration experience and injuries at the destination are the main determinants of poor self-rated health and chronic disease. Furthermore, elderly return migrants have high-risk health behaviours such as smoking and alcohol consumption, as well as less access to health schemes. \n\nDespite some shortcomings, this study identifies the most vulnerable groups among the elderly and their health characteristics. This will help to promote healthy ageing in Kerala, India, or areas with increasing numbers of elderly and return migrants around the world."

These patches ranging from less than a hectare to upward of hundreds of hectares have protected numerous flora and fauna that are often not found outside their boundaries. Sacred groves are an important part of the hydrologic cycle in their communities as they contain ponds and lakes for storing water. Increase pressure for land to accommodate the needs of a growing population has resulted in their loss throughout the state. This has resulted in species loss due to a host of reasons including habitat loss, fragmentation, invasive species, increased traffic from tourists, pollution, etc. Anthropogenic influences are largely blamed for their degradation. This chapter provides an overview of sacred groves and the current threats they face."

    "abstract": "Globally, Indigenous Peoples are the stewards of a large portion of the global land base, and their interactions and associations with the land have shaped and sustained it for centuries. Yet conservation studies and land management practices still struggle to understand or use Indigenous interpretations of the natural world. In many cases, this perpetuates a colonial sensibility across land use policies, which also dangerously misrepresents Indigenous relationships with that land. \n\nThis paper focuses on Kattunayakans, a hunter-forager Adivasi (Indigenous) community living within the Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary in Kerala, India. Our focus is how they characterize kadu (‘forest’ in Kattunayakan language), both what it is constituted of and what it means from an Adivasi point of view. \n\nUsing open-ended interviews, transect walks, and spatial mapping we find that for Kattunayakans, the forest is seen as an entity with agency; and a body of discrete biocultural landscape units classified as: a convergence of good places and God people; and a realm of spaces populated by kinfolk with fluid human-and-nonhuman identities that do not follow any physical boundaries of protected areas. \n\nThis understanding of what a protected area forest is and is comprised of is neither adequately represented and discussed in the history of India's protected areas nor addressed in forest and wildlife management policies and approaches. This is highly consequential for Adivasi communities such as Kattunayakans, who do not have written or material evidence of their productive and historical relationship to forest land. \n\nWe argue, as well, that when engaged appropriately, Adivasi portrayals of the kadu can bolster equity in land management and strengthen collaborative governance that more broadly advances human rights alongside the goals of biodiversity conservation."

Using ethnographic data from Kerala, India and Atlanta, GA USA, a description of two types of homes are developed: the custodial home, which is primarily focused on caring for basic needs, and the therapeutic home, which is focused on changing a child’s autistic traits. The type of home environment is respondent to cultural practices of child rearing in the home and influences daily activities, management, and care in the home. Further, these homes differ in parental acceptance of their autistic children’s disabilities, which is critical to understand when engaging in international work related to autism and intellectual disability. It is proposed that parental acceptance can be fostered through the use of neurodiverse notions that encourage autism acceptance."

    "abstract": "Explanatory models (EMs) are the way people explain the presence and meaning of an illness or disability and are reliant on and reflective of culturally specific values of normalcy, disability, health, and illness. EMs about autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are particularly revealing because there is no known cause, and so people can explain this disability in ways more appropriate for and useful to them. This article presents caretaker EMs about children with autistic characteristics in Kerala, India. I argue that the reliance on biological, but not genetic, causal models is reflective of the state’s high access to biomedical heath care. These EMs are used to deflect the stigma of ‘bad blood’ and reflect a nuanced relationship between stigma and biological EMs. Understanding how caretakers talk about ASD and related conditions is critical for anyone interested in engaging in crosscultural or international autism-related work."

This study presents a case study of motivations of women to use information and communication technologies (ICT) in a ubiquitous information environment. This study follows an interpretive paradigm to explore an understanding of culture and gender in a middle-class Indian context. Women in this report varied in terms of heavy/light and mandatory/voluntary use. We discuss the implications of such variations in terms of technology adoption for digital inclusion. Social factors, such as the role of parents and social communities, were found to influence women to develop and maintain interests in ICT that were reflected in their professional and personal lives. Some women were slow to adapt to ICT use as they tended to adhere to normative expectations which hindered ICT use. Women tend to have greater ICT use if it is for fulfilling familial roles and for communication."

An analytical study of the data obtained from the inbuilt analytics tools available with WordPress, Facebook and Twitter was conducted based on five performance social metrics (activity, audience, engagement, referral and return on investment). The analysis revealed that blog was the most used social media channel by students and teachers to get academic resources, followed by Twitter and Facebook. The reach and engagement was maximum among people in the age group of 18-24. Most shared posts on the channels were of academic in nature and content whereas, posts with photographs recorded maximum likes, clicks and comments. The study also confirmed the trustworthiness of resources provided by government agencies. The analysis of the return on investment metric underlined the success of social media channels in libraries as valuable investment options for present and future."

A descriptive survey with structured questionnaires was conducted to collect data from a representative sample of 179 students of 35 teaching departments at the University of Calicut, Kerala. The analysis reveals that Social Networking Sites and Wikis are the most used online reading platforms by the students. A majority of the students use mobile phones and laptop computers for reading online. The students download and save materials from the Internet for reading. A majority of the students prefer Times New Roman font type, 12 point legible font size and 1.5 inch line spacing. They strongly agree that small font size and line spacing make the text visually uncomfortable for reading online. Eye fatigue is the major problem faced by the students while reading online. However, a few students opined that the inability to leave marks or make notes on online documents, low rate of comprehension, dead-end webpages, inappropriate background colour, skipping links are their concerns while reading online. As the study sheds light on the effects of typographical factors in online reading, it will go a long way in designing online interfaces for e-learning."

    "abstract": "This paper looks at the genre of soft pornography in the Malayalam-speaking south Indian state of Kerala and the precarious stardom of its female stars through a close look at the career of Shakeela, an actress who became the emblematic soft-porn star of the 1990s. \n\nIt interrogates how Shakeela's outsider status and her heavyset body type foregrounded her as the locus of Malayali society's conflicted relationship with sex and desire while also creating a set of parallel film practices that challenged the hierarchies of the mainstream film industry. By 2001 more than 70 percent of the total films produced in Malayalam were soft porn, and a good number of them featured Shakeela. \n\nThe mainstay of soft-porn productions was the strategic positioning of the female lead as a cultural outsider—a transient figure who is both a threat and a source of exoticized desire. Shakeela's emergence as a “liberated” woman who flaunts her sexuality despite social norms was so strong that it destabilized Kerala's hero-centric mainstream industry for a time, leading to what was popularly called Shakeela tharangam, the “wave of Shakeela.”"

    "abstract": "Global demand for food increases exponentially, but traditional agricultural practices could not meet the demand in production without compromising the nutrients and quality of food and the soil. India depends on agriculture, and the scarcity of water has been increasing. So, we are in a critical situation to save water and use it wisely. \n\nWe have designed an automatic watering system using Arduino and IoT technology which helps farmers to irrigate plants automatically by sensing the moisture content in the soil using soil moisture sensor. The problem occurs on crops due to attacks by wild animals. Crops are frequently devasted by wildlife in Karnataka, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Punjab. Domestic animals and birds are also having an impact on crops. In order to overcome this problem, we use PIR sensors to detect wild animals, birds, etc. \n\nHigh accuracy is required in terms of weather conditions, which will make a major impact on agricultural products. For this problem we are giving a solution by using rain and light sensor for the weather forecasting to detect rain, which will avoid the overflow of water to plants or crops. As this system is an automatic process, it will reduce the work pressure of the farmers. It keeps on indicating every movement of the field to the farmer via an LCD display and giving an alert message to the farmer's mobile under the following situations: When an external living creature enters the agricultural field, such as rats, wild pigs, etc., it will produce a buzzer sound with a higher frequency range. If the moisture content is low, automatically irrigation will be started and it will also be notified to the farmer's mobile. \n\nWith the help of weather forecasting technology implemented in this paper farmers will be easily alerted with the monsoon climatic changes. They can then act accordingly to save their crops and the automatic irrigation process also will be stopped."

This paper presents teachers’ narratives and explores cultural beliefs concerning childhood sexuality.\n\nThe investigation attempted to understand ways in which the cross-cutting modalities of religion, caste, gender, and sexuality of the teacher and the student shape students’ sexual subjectivities. The ‘Domains of Power’ as outlined by Patricia. H. Collins was used to analyse teacher interviews to understand how dominant sexualities are privileged and attain their power within schools. Further, a descriptive analysis is provided for how power relations inform interactions between students and teachers and how such interactions shape teachers’ expectations of students’ sexual knowledge, experiences, and expressions.\n\nTwo broad themes emerge from the analysis: the way schools monitor students ‘undesired’ sexualities and the sexualities of ‘undesired’ students. Both students and their sexualities are marked, categorised, placed in hierarchies, and disciplined into acceptable sexual norms of society.\n\nWe provide an account of ways in which schools try to construct particular sexual identities and regulate some non-preferred sexual identities. Our work contributes to the larger work on sexual identity formation in schools."

It unravels the reasons for this un-precedented success story of creating a ‘Shakespeare commons’ in Kerala. It examines the kathaprasangams of Othello and Romeo and Juliet and will investigate the contribution of the performer, his music, the form and the contexts which nourished it. It will glance at the concepts and methodologies of orality to analyse the modes of composition, performance and reception of this form of story-singing, harking back to early oral traditions, and how it communicated Shakespeare. It will argue that apart from the local popularity, the larger significance of such ‘oral’ renderings is that they tap into and extend, in a particular manner, the residual ‘orality’ and expressivity of the plays and the poetry, something which is seldom attended to in the text-heavy study of Shakespeare."

    "abstract": "Cluster randomized trials (CRTs) are studies where treatment is randomised at the cluster level but outcomes are typically collected at the individual level. When CRTs are employed in pragmatic settings, baseline population characteristics may moderate treatment effects, leading to what is known as heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs). Pre-specified, hypothesis-driven HTE analyses in CRTs can enable an understanding of how interventions may impact subpopulation outcomes. \n\nWhile closed-form sample size formulas have recently been proposed, assuming known intracluster correlation coefficients (ICCs) for both the covariate and outcome, guidance on optimal cluster randomized designs to ensure maximum power with pre-specified HTE analyses has not yet been developed. \n\nWe derive new design formulas to determine the cluster size and number of clusters to achieve the locally optimal design (LOD) that minimizes variance for estimating the HTE parameter given a budget constraint. Given the LODs are based on covariate and outcome-ICC values that are usually unknown, we further develop the maximin design for assessing HTE, identifying the combination of design resources that maximize the relative efficiency of the HTE analysis in the worst case scenario. \n\nIn addition, given the analysis of the average treatment effect is often of primary interest, we also establish optimal designs to accommodate multiple objectives by combining considerations for studying both the average and heterogeneous treatment effects. \n\nWe illustrate our methods using the context of the Kerala Diabetes Prevention Program CRT, and provide an R Shiny app to facilitate calculation of optimal designs under a wide range of design parameters."

    "abstract": "The pace of industrial and allied infrastructure development in India is encumbered by scarcity in the supply of land. As a result, the state in India has frequently resorted to expropriation of land through conversion of land away from its traditional uses and through displacement of communities. Consequently, land acquisition in the country is mired in disputes over human rights and environmental rights violations. In the face of continued political support for infrastructure-led development in India, those who stand to lose their land have often resorted to judicial recourse for pressing their rights. \n\nThis article draws on empirical evidence from court cases related to two urban development projects in the states of Karnataka and Kerala to examine how courts have responded to the question of violation of land rights and appeals against land acquisition for the two projects. \n\nThe author argues that the courts, while responding to the claims against the two projects, have refrained from holding the implementing agencies or the state governments accountable even in cases where there were recognisable incidents of malfeasance. \n\nThe article illustrates that the inability of the courts to confront the state lends a tacit assent to the development agenda of the state."

As a result, groundwater may be very important to the development and well-being of many nations if it is properly evaluated and utilised. Although the possibility for sustainable groundwater resource development is still debated in the literature, these issues still lack quantitative understanding. \n\nIn order to assess groundwater potential in two different urbanised regions of “Northern Kerala, Southern India,” this research uses the “Enhanced Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (E-Fuzzy AHP) based Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM)-Geospatial Framework employing Improved Particle Swarm Optimization (IPSO)”. \n\nThe study area is a coastal region that is quickly becoming urbanised and relies on groundwater resources to meet its basic needs. By incorporating both spatial and non-spatial data into the Geographic Information System (GIS) platform, a groundwater potential zone map with an accurate integer value was created, known as the “groundwater potential index (GWPI)”. \n\nThe very excellent potential zone occupies 35% and 11%, respectively, of the “urban and peri-urban zones,” according to the final groundwater potential map, which employed the quantile technique to split the research territory into four zones. The statistical effectiveness and dependability of results in the overall decision-making phase were examined in the validation study using the data on mean water depth level, and it was found that the reliability was well within the tolerance threshold."

A study was carried out in this work to determine the quality of groundwater in the Achenkovil River Basin (ARB) in the Southern Western Ghats region of Kerala, India. \n\nA total of 25 dug well water samples were collected from the vicinity of aggregate quarries during the pre and post monsoon seasons of 2020–2021. The water quality index has been applied to categorize the water quality, namely, excellent, good, poor, etc. to infer the quality of water to the people and policy makers in the concerned area. The WQI results showed that 12% of the water samples in good and 28% depict in very poor category. The Hill-Piper Trilinear diagram reveals that the groundwater of the study area falls under Ca2+/Mg2+, and HCO3− and SO42−, Cl−, Mg2+ types. The hydro-chemistry of the rock-dominant water type of the quarrying area is inhibited by geogenic-processes along with the percolation of prevailing quarry leachate and infiltration into the nearby wells. \n\nThe correlation matrix has been created and analysed to observe their significant impetus on the assessment of groundwater quality. The overall quality of groundwater systems in the quarrying area, according to the various indices, is not fit for domestic consumption without mandatory quality treatment, but is suitable for irrigation."

    "abstract": "The paper examines how Hindu nationalist social service organizations, specifically the Deseeya Seva Bharathi (DSB), reconfigured the religious conception of ‘Seva’ to advance the project of constructing a Hindu social identity during the COVID-19 pandemic in the state of Kerala. \n\nThe southern Indian state of Kerala has remained an exception in the story of the rise of the Hindu nationalist movement in contemporary India, which has repeatedly failed to make any considerable political inroads in the state. However, the disastrous economic consequences and livelihood challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic in the state, which was heavily dependent on foreign remittance and service industries, have opened up new spaces of engagement for Hindu nationalists. \n\nDrawing on fieldwork conducted in central Kerala during the pandemic, this paper elaborates how the DSB used the crisis moment of the pandemic to reach out to economically and socially disadvantaged communities using the language of ‘Seva’ to build a Hindu social identity, which imbues the influence of majoritarian Hindu nationalist politics. \n\nThe paper argues that the DSB’s articulation of ‘Seva’ as a distinct and superior form of social service that is ‘self-less’, ‘non-instrumental’, and ‘non-reciprocal’ is significant in understanding the growing appeal of Hindu nationalist social service in the contested political sphere of Kerala, which is marked by competing social provisions by the state as well as other secular and religious groups. \n\nThe paper notes that the reconfiguration of ‘Seva’ as a continuous religious concept enables Hindu nationalists to attain greater acceptance and legitimacy that even the secular state welfare could not achieve, while also concealing the inherent instrumental nature of its social service towards the construction of a Hindu social identity in the region."

This article examines the chasm between land demands and state responses in such contexts.\n\nFocusing on the Aralam resettlement site for the landless Adivasis in Kerala, India, it argues that management of the landless could take the form of ‘state life’ — a life envisaged by the state rather than the life the people wish to lead. \n\nThree interlinked processes are shown to shape state life in Kerala: the reduction of land to welfare, amplified welfare transfers and the mobilization of assumptions about the target population. State life enables states to extinguish simmering land struggles in the short term, but ultimately it reproduces landlessness."

    "abstract": "This article, based on a primary survey in two villages of Wayanad district in Kerala, argues that the high incidence of landlessness, as well as the predominance of marginal and small landholdings, has maintained a high incidence of tenancy in Kerala. \n\nThe tenancy market is dominated by farmers with smaller landholdings. The land is leased mainly for the cultivation of cash crops under cash rents. The land for leasing is supplied by those landed households who have withdrawn from agriculture due to better earnings from non-farm sector, difficulties in procuring labour for agricultural tasks and dwindling irrigation resources. \n\nThe landless and marginal-small farming households predominantly form the pool of lessees who lease land for two important reasons. First, the growing opportunities in the non-farm sector have been uneven in nature in the sense that they have absorbed only a section of rural labour, leaving many others to remain in cultivation and augment their family income through the leasing of land. \n\nSecond, lease cultivation, in spite of high fluctuations in the prices and production of crops, is generally profitable for lessees in normal years and when the prices are on an upswing. Given the role of land leasing in providing economic support to rural poor households, the state government should revisit the legal ban of land leasing on Kerala."

    "abstract": "With hundreds of people losing their houses and properties, climate change and its related disasters have changed the face of humanity. This has had a considerable impact on popular visual media such as film as well. From the conventional romanticised portrayal of nature in Malayalam films, a few contemporary Malayalam films have sensitised the ecological issues and the predicaments of its victims. This marks the shift from the idealised portrayal of landscape to the depiction of the fury of nature on human beings. \n\nTaking cues from a Posthumanist theoretical perspective, this article considers the Malayalam film <i>Veyilmarangal</i> (2020) directed by Dr. Biju Damodaran to analyse how caste divisions in society surface during the climate catastrophe. \n\nTo analyse the nuances of climate change and its posthuman turn, this article takes its insights from the domains of environmental casteism and climate displacement to explain what is used as ‘eco-caste migrants’ in this article. The term signifies the role of caste hierarchy among human and non-human entities during the ecological crisis, especially focusing on the experiences of the Dalits and other caste subalterns. \n\nThe article also attempts to find parallels between the non-human group and sub-human group hierarchies in society and, thereby, analyse the intersectional casteism from the vantage point of Kerala society through the representation of eco-caste migrants in the film."

    "abstract": "The identification and representation of Persons with Disabilities (PwDs) has been a contentious issue due to the lack of methodological standardisation. This study scrutinises the methodological innovation made by the Indian state of Kerala for identifying PwDs in its special census on disability in 2015. \n\nThe study used disability data from the 15th Census of India and the Disability Census (DC) of Kerala and used descriptive statistics to compare the two on demographic, health, social, and economic dimensions. \n\nThe prevalence of disability in Kerala was found to be around 2.2% in both the censuses. However, between the two data sources, the share of different disabilities varied from 1% in the case of mental retardation to as much as 10% in the case of locomotor disability. Robust data collection in two stages by trained health professionals, incorporation of detailed categories of disabling conditions, and inclusion of a large number of dimensions in DC made it an effective survey. \n\nIt is important to improve the identification of PwDs to properly address their unique needs and promote an inclusive development. Defining ‘mental retardation’ to capture disability can be derogatory to many; however, disability in mental health has been defined as ‘mental retardation’ and ‘mental illness’ in the 15th round of the Census of India. As a result, these are the terms that will be used throughout the article."

The discontent with the popular imagination of Kerala started to gain momentum in the 1980s and 1990s. By then, the less privileged groups, such as women and Dalits, found reasons to contest the false promises of a modern secular society and the principles of socialist ideology. \n\nThe study focuses on the intellectual engagements of two Dalit intellectuals from Kerala. K. K. Kochu and M. Kunjaman trace their epistemological framework through dissent and disagreement. Their discontent creates a rift in the hegemonic discourses produced by upper castes, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in Kerala, and other power structures. K. K. Kochu’s <i>Dalithan</i> (Dalit) and M. Kunjaman’s <i>Ethiru</i> (Dissent) are two autobiographical accounts that map out the intellectual life of these two prominent public figures."

Drawing insights from two-year-long ethnographic fieldwork, this article sheds light upon the unfolding of Parayans’ everyday life and the process of self-identification besides explicating the ontic properties of the Parayans’ language. \n\nIn a subtle manner, the article adopts the methodology of ‘linguistic turn’ and urges Dalit scholarship to attune itself to afresh conceptual orientation so that it can bring the linguistic question as the central a priori of discussions in relation to life, identification, and subjectivity of Dalit beings."

    "abstract": "In post-independence India, as in many developing post-colonial nations, the capitalist class was dependent on the state to discipline the labourforce, and the rapid uptake of capitalist production methods prompted the new government to intervene aggressively in industrial labour relations. \n\nThe main goal of postcolonial labor policy was to maintain peaceful labor relations at any cost in order to foster economic development. The newly elected government failed to help capitalists increase their profits through productivity growth, so the way forward was to impose restrictions on labor. Pro-capital labor legislation initially enabled capitalists to curb the mobility and resistance of workers. In due course, however, irrespective of how consistently or effectively labor regulations and repressive measures were enforced, the reaction of the working class heightened its political consciousness, and thus aggravated frictions between capital and labour. When the state resorted to labour welfare laws as a new strategy to reduce these conflicts, employers often fragmented production among smaller units (such as workshops and households) in order to dodge labour regulations. As a reaction to this production decentralisation, the working-class movement created impediments to the process of continual capital accumulation."

The elephant moves into a fantasy of the wild as it is under the physiological condition of musth. Approaching the question of the performing animal as intersectional, this performance challenges anthropocentrism and its assumed binary of human/animal, and draws a possible relation between domestic and wild, or the world of norms and freedom, both for elephants and for humans.\n\nI argue that by taking embodiment as the site of exploring discipline as well as imagining a freeing, and by positing an alternate way of ‘being worldly’ through affect and senses, the performance articulates what Donna Haraway has posited as the process of ‘becoming with’."

    "abstract": "This paper traces past and present entanglements between people and elephants along a forest-agriculture fringe in Kerala's Western Ghats. In doing so, it explores the evolution of conservation-linked conflict and its problematic impacts. \n\nOver the centuries, the region's elephants have played a dominant role in its mountain landscapes: as antagonists to cultivators; as sources of ivory, labour and revenue to forest traders, local rulers and imperial administrators; and as cultural and religious icons straddling forests and countryside. Environmental protection arrangements in recent years ushered in a new elephant, a charismatic flagship beloved of conservationists, but also a key actor involved in fluctuating tensions along the forest edge. \n\nIn this study, I explore long-term engagements between people and elephants by interrogating three critical phases in history, each incorporating a changing identity for the place in question: as a bountiful, ivory-rich forest at the turn of the Christian Era; as a site of capitalist production during the colonial period; and eventually as a contested conservation landscape. I show that these identities are predicated as much by extra-local processes such as migration and capitalist enterprises, as by embedded engagements with non-human agency. \n\nContemporary conflict is, therefore, a complex ongoing narrative fuelled by a dynamic interaction between the persistence of human and animal memories as well as by multi-scale socio-political catalysts with long histories of influence. By ignoring historical contingencies and diverse discourses, contemporary conservation interventions may overlook the proverbial and sometimes literal elephant in the room."

Drawing on ethnography within the Indian forest department and among elephant handlers in Wayanad, Kerala, it highlights the largely invisible work relationship between indigenous forest labourers and captive elephants, and their essential contribution to wildlife management. Extending ethnographic attention beyond an exclusively human realm, I show that human and elephant relations have been co-constituted while working together for the forest department. Their working partnership, situated in the historical nature-cultures of logging, teak extraction, and conservation, has created ambivalent intimacies between humans and elephants, containing both mutual violence and affect. By highlighting the importance of work relationships, history, and questions of power for multi-species studies, this article argues that human–animal relations are not only shaped by individual intimacies, but also by danger, risk, and aggression, situated within a region's larger political ecology."

The first part contextualises Aithihyamala and reads into the rich dialogic connections it has with diverse cultural and literary domains. \n\nThe second part explores the possibilities of representing the elephant as a conscious, diligent, and emotional being and problematises simplistic notions of anthropomorphism. \n\nThe paper argues how the elephant stories may be instrumental in generating affection, compassion, and curiosity about the animal-hero, which might, in the long run, result in justice for elephants by creating a sense of answerability in human beings."

Yet Dalit studies have developed epistemologies, bringing articulations and ideas from the margins to the centre of writings on history, leading to debates around caste that have transformed notions of politics. \n\nThis paper draws from one such trajectory through a nonlinear narrative, juxtaposing the intergenerational contexts of engagements: my mother Dakshayani’s political and life experiences, as narrated in her autobiography (1912–1978), and my own experience in the Dalit women’s and other movements in the 1980s and 1990s. \n\nWhile my experience saw the onset of liberalisation and the emergence and growth of ‘new social movements’, the context of Dakshayani’s narrations is the Pulaya (agrestic slave caste) community in the early 1900s in Cochin, a community in the process of transforming itself. \n\nBoth narratives highlight how radical traditions within the Dalit women’s movement over time have consciously and critically addressed anti-caste movements, social reform, the state, peoples’ movements and the nation within a conceptual framework of equality, liberty and non-discrimination."

    "abstract": "<i>Udalaazham</i> (Body Deep), the 2018 Malayalam film directed by Unnikrishnan Avala, intrigues into the precarious dimensions of gender liminality in unprecedented ways by being the first film to discuss the life of a gender-liminal belonging to a tribal (Paniya) community in Kerala. \n\nThe paper engages in a close reading and analysis of the film-text Udalaazham by placing it in juxtaposition to figurations of transgender subjectivities in contemporary Malayalam films, with an aim to contest the acclaimed progressive disposition of these mainstream representations. \n\nIt employs the framework of intersectionality to focus on the protagonist Gulikan’s lived experiences enmeshed within the structures of tribal caste, ethnicity and gender characterised by multiple interlocking dimensions of precarity. His body, identity and desires are open to threat, violence, mutilations and perpetual questioning due to lack of socio-cultural capital and support network. \n\nThe relevance of this film is in opening up the discussions on caste and liminal gender identity and thereby urging the dire need to re-write the formula of identity politics in the region and its popular culture. Reading Udalaazham in this context provides a more liberating yet disturbing space to discuss the regressive operations of identity categories and their limitations in conceptualising regional queer identities in India."

    "abstract": "In developing countries, the implementation of bicycle sharing programmes is in a nascent stage; this paper provides a preliminary understanding of bicycle sharing trip activity introduced in Kerala, India. \n\nFundamentally, a framework is utilised to incorporate spatial interaction effects and estimate the bicycle sharing trip activity using spatial econometric techniques. MYBYK is the associated bicycle rental company, with 67 stations in the various major locations at Cochin, Kalamasery, Choornikkarra, and Aluva cities in India. Information such as socio-demographic, bicycle sharing trip activity, weather, and built environment information were collected in the study regions. Initially, spatiotemporal variation is analysed to understand the bicycle-sharing trip activity. Then, spatial indicators are determined using Moran's I technique, and the study area's locational information is transmitted to the spatial weight matrix to illustrate the spatial neighbourhood structure. Finally, Trip Production and Trip Attraction models were developed for estimating the bicycle sharing trip activity using five spatial econometric techniques as Spatial Autoregressive (SAR) model, Spatially Lagged X model (SLX), Spatial Error Model (SEM), Spatial Durbin Error model (SDEM), and Spatial Durbin Model (SDM). The models are evaluated, and an appropriate model is found using the Bayesian approach. \n\nThe findings indicate that SDM effectively estimates the bicycle sharing trip activity, and its spillover effects are also addressed for each spatial indicator variable."

Plantation capitalism, therefore, sustained itself not only through overt forms of violence but also through manipulating the precarity of employment in relation to intimate forms of love, care, and obligation that were bound up with kinship ties. \n\nKinship networks of different kinds need to be understood as integral to the plantation society and as occupying a fundamental place within the capitalist order of plantations. I observe that the entangled relationship between workers’ precarity and plantation capitalism can be understood only if we pay attention to what I call the intimate precarity produced by the employment of kinship networks within plantation capitalism."

This study aimed to capture nurses’ perceptions of healthcare services in India.\n\nMaterials and Methods: An exploratory study design was adopted. 554 nurses from selected public and private hospitals in Kerala, India, were randomly selected for the study. The data were analysed quantitatively with SPSS 23.0.\n\nResults: The perception of nurses in all dimensions of the HQP is observed as high (>3.5), with the exception of their involvement in quality management, which is reported as medium (2.5–3.49). Further, a significant difference between public and private hospitals (p < 0.05) is observed for all variablesl, except for the perceived effectiveness of quality improvement (p = 0.81) and the availability of training and development opportunities (p = 0.80). Additionally, nurses working in accredited hospitals (mean = 3.78) have more positive perceptions than non-accredited hospitals (mean = 3.69) (p < 0.05). Female nurses show a significantly more positive attitude toward the quality of health services than their male colleagues.\n\nConclusion: The participating nurses were aware of various aspects of the quality management systems in their respective hospitals. In addition, the public and private hospitals and the accredited and non-accredited hospitals differed in their quality practices, as reflected in the nurses’ voices. This study would help healthcare policy planners enhance the quality of the public sectors in India."

Colonialist historiography aimed to popularise the achievements of Europeans stationed in the empire. The representation of European characters in <i>The Jewel of Malabar</i>, a novel published in 1927 by the English soldier and writer Donald Ryder Stephens under the pen name Donald Sinderby, accepts the colonisers’ righteous intent of introducing Western culture and religion and the scientific temperament into the colonies. \n\nThe article argues that a power nexus existed between the colonisers and natives (perceived as elites by various social groups) and shows how the social transactions between the two led to an internalisation and proliferation of the need of the white saviour. \n\nA close analysis of The Jewel of Malabar examines the nature of social transactions between the coloniser and the colonised, and demonstrates the creation of a dependency that is perceived as a symbiotic arrangement, by which some natives are protected from others while giving the colonisers a firmer command of the colony’s resources. \n\nFurthermore, the article also explores how Western modernisation was used to provide a righteous intent cloaking the colonisers’ motives (conquest and exploitation) while intensifying the existing binary within colonies, that of nondangerous natives needing protection from dangerous ones, with Hindus and Moplahs playing these roles."

It contemplates the socio-economic and anthropological significance of measures to filter and alkalinise tap water and to transform ‘dead’ municipal waters into healing waters with the power to ‘cure cancer’. \n\nTechnological and infrastructural innovation is a means to an end in these safeguarding efforts; it enables what I argue are ‘buffering practices’ that allow a potentially dangerous element to feel restorative and wholesome once more.

What is significant is that the participation comes only from the poor and the lower middle class people. The growing tendency of the middle classes and the relatively better off sections of the people to keep away from participation in the grama sabha meetings is obvious. With increasing levels of education and affluence their lack of interest for participation was also found rising. It appears that the educated and the articulate middle class, which is expected to contribute significantly to the planning process, is increasingly giving up its social role. It is the poor and the lower sections of the middle class who appreciate the empowering potential of the grama sabha. They are also found holding a more serious attitude towards political and democratic causes as judged from their involvement in various social activities. The growing environment of neo-liberal policies is a disincentive for the privileged sections of the middle classes who benefit from such policies to join collective social action. This at least partially explains the lower participation levels of the middle classes in social and political activities. However, the declining participation is not exclusively the result of class behaviour. There are inherent problems in the methodology of planning which needs to be addressed to ensure better administrative co-ordination and co-operation in decentralised planning"

    "abstract": "Unlike Sri Lanka, the Philippines or Indonesia, the major structuring contexts of international migration from Kerala/India do not enable the mobility of less-skilled women workers, yet it has been observed that they are a prominent presence in some Middle Eastern destinations.  Legal provisions designed by the Indian state apparently to protect less-skilled women raise the barriers to their movement.  There are also cultural restrictions as overseas mobility removes women workers from the everyday regulatory scope of local/family patriarchy. Autonomous migration by less-skilled women defies the gender norm in Kerala which mandates marital control over women’s sexuality.  These factors render the agency of emigrant women workers oppositional, at once defiant and compromised. Recent work suggests that women migrate as domestic workers when there is a compelling need by flouting state regulation through easily accessible parallel channels. But in a cultural milieu that is hostile to women’s autonomous migration, it is important to ask how less-skilled women overcome cultural barriers at home i.e., who goes and what negotiations underpin their movement? The women whose narratives I analyze here turned to overseas work to improve their lives; but they emphasize the failure of marriage to provide a livelihood as the condition that shaped their decision to migrate. This paper draws upon a selection of narratives from interviews with over 150 less-skilled emigrant and returnee women workers from Trivandrum District to argue that the conditions that structure international migration from Kerala marginalises women, narrowing the material base from which aspiring migrants are drawn and rendering their agency suspect but emigrant women maneuver local and family patriarchy by foregrounding the failure of marital provisioning and create the space to go."

In the present study, the conservation status of 20 protected areas of the Western Ghats was analysed based on long-term changes in forests (1975–1985–1995–2005–2013), landscape-level changes in fragmentation, and forest fires (2005–2015). \n\nThis study has shown that a significant forest loss occurred in protected areas before declaration. Idukki is one of the major protected areas which showed a drastic reduction (18.83%) in its forest cover. \n\nDuring 1985–1995, Periyar tiger reserve had lost 24.19 sq. km core 3 forest area followed by Peppara (18.54 sq. km), Parambikulam (17.93 sq. km), Chimmony (17.71 sq. km), Peechi-Vazhani (12.31 sq. km), and Neyyar (11.67 sq. km). \n\nAn area of 71.33 sq. km of the protected area was affected by fires in 2014. Overall protected area-wise decadal analysis indicates Periyar has the highest number of fire incidences followed by Wayanad, Kurinjimala, Silent Valley, and Eravikulam. Disturbances in the form of fires and fragmentation still exist and may have significant conservation threat to flora and fauna. \n\nAmong protected areas, many are having a probability to go under threat or dynamic stage. Chinnar, Thattekkad, and Kurinjimala sanctuaries are representing high levels of vulnerability, or they are near to decline stage. \n\nHabitat level monitoring of the anthropogenic disturbances can be efficiently useful for the strategic conservation planning. The present study has provided a geospatial database on spatial patterns of deforestation, fragmentation, and forest fires in protected areas of Kerala. \n\nA conservation prioritisation approach based on these parameters will be useful for strategic planning in the state of Kerala."

We argue that as they are tied to international migration, money and information and communication technologies (ICTs) co-shape new norms of filial care by transforming the normative expectations of ‘good daughters’. \n\nThis article reveals how, among Keralite transnational nurse families, ‘good daughters’ may increase their bargaining power with their in-laws, specifically in relation to caring for their own parents, and how this may also influence the position of men as husbands and sons-in-law."

However, its original palm-leaf manuscript (ōla) is kept at the British Library. \nThis ōla, entitled Kēraḷa Varttamānam, brings to light some remarkable omissions and a few discrepancies in Wye's translation. \n\nClosely reading different manuscripts in Malayalam, Arabic, and English I argue that this ōla is in fact a translation of a 16th-century Arabic text, Tuḥfat al-mujāhidīn, well known among scholars of its place and period. \n\nTaking it a step ahead, I argue that the very existence of this text points towards the cross-cultural and cross-linguistic interactions between the Arabic and Malayalam spheres of premodern Malabar. \nThe ōla demonstrates one of the first instances of Malayalam literature's engagement with a secular and historical theme as the arrival of the Portuguese. \nIn addition, Malayalam works such as Kēraḷōlpatti and Kēraḷa-paḻama are clear voices from Malabar on the Portuguese arrival and consequent episodes."

    "abstract": "Depression has become a major public health concern in Kerala, South India. Media and mental health professionals often attribute the rise of depression and suicide to a discontent around modern transformations and the flipside of the 'Kerala model of development'. \n\nKerala’s primary healthcare system of health governance, surveillance, and care, with its backbone of community and multi-purpose health workers, is currently being expanded to target inner feelings, emotional suffering, and existential despair, as a result of complex global, national and local processes of making visible and stabilising depression as a public health category. Rather than relying on NGOs and foreign funding, mental health policy planners in Kerala engage the state of Kerala. \n\nUsing the case of a junior health inspector’s counseling, I argue that the reconfiguration of suffering from an existential part of life and symptom of adversity into a medical condition can also lead to mobilisation of (gendered) care in a context of familial marginalisation and neglect. In this context, individual bodies are healed by restoring social bodies. Medicalisation does not necessarily silence social inequalities and marginalization but can become productive in providing an idiom to critique a family’s moral economy."

We interrogate the Gramamukhya portal, which was initiated in 2011 and continued until 2015, as a democratic space to politicise the invited spaces of governance. Revisiting the question of women’s engagement in panchayati raj institutions in Kerala, we suggest that the practice of citizenship can become politically effective for women in governance if they use a platform that facilitates critical engagement from within and without the invited spaces of participation. This reflection becomes all the more significant given the contemporary political context of Kerala, where the women’s question is caught between developmentalist intentions of the state and right-wing political mobilisations at the grass-roots level."

Within Kerala, Muslims are the most educationally backward religious group, notwithstanding their favourable economic position and political strength within the state. \n\nLastly, Kerala Muslim women are the most disadvantaged group in that they face triple-discrimination in education; discrimination based on religion, gender, and geographic inequalities. \nIn the Kerala development model, Muslims, especially the Muslim women are the most marginalised group who need further support from state machineries to overcome the decades-long educational backwardness."

This article explores the histories of this policy in the ‘model’ princely state of Travancore. The essay integrates medical and social history as it tracks the introduction and progress of vaccination into the princely state and examines the process as biomedical discourse about disease and public health, and as a set of corporeal practices. The article also examines the broader cultural meanings ascribed to biomedicine in this princely state and the efforts to construct a ‘modern’ corporeal consciousness through direct and indirect interventions. Finally, the article also engages with the question of what exactly the introduction of biomedicine entailed for the average resident of this region in terms of disease control and prevention."

    "abstract": "Migration is unarguably the most influential process that has determined what the Kerala state is now. The process has great impact as far as all the fields of life in the state are concerned. This process of emigration facilitated the replacement migration of labourers from other states of Kerala. \n\nReplacement migration is mainly due to the large-scale migration of young working populations, along with the unwillingness of the people of Kerala to do manual work. A large number of migrant labourers got attracted to the state due to high wage rate and better working and living conditions, which helped to reduce this imbalance between demand for, and supply of, labour. \n\nThis labour in-migration obviously affected the economy and society to a great extent not only in positive but in negative terms also. One of the major adverse effects of in-migration is supposed to be in the labour market of the native workers.\n\nThis paper examines whether the labour migration to Kerala is competitive or complementary to the native workers. This is examined in the framework of the competitive and complementary effect aspect of Borjas’ theory of immigration, and supported by evidence from a primary survey. The study finds that in-migration in the present context is not a threat to the native workers as majority of the in-migrants is unskilled or semi-skilled, and cannot compete with the skilled native workers of Kerala."

These material-legal processes are also acutely gendered, underscoring wider calls for a feminist approach to legal geographies. \n\nInformed by a comparative empirically driven study, this paper explores how, in both contexts, urban interventions work to enhance gender equality through improving women’s material shelter in the city, and introduce tenure security, often prioritising very poor women. Yet, their implementation is riddled with slippages as well as operating within a broader poverty-patriarchy nexus. This means that these legally framed benefits have occurred alongside complex and perverse outcomes including unemployment, gendered tensions, and acute loss of privacy for some.\n\nHousing interventions produce uneven legal geographies, with persisting gendered inequalities and poverty distorting residents’ abilities to benefit from material-legal interventions aimed at improving their lives."

    "abstract": "Countries of origins are witnessing an increasing rate of return migration of temporary labour migrants in the past decade. This paper analyses the process of reintegration of return migrants in Indian context by examining Kerala as a case study, and portrays the existing state responses towards return migrants. \n\nKerala is selected because of the rich tradition of international labour migration and the existence of a state-run institutional mechanisms to manage migration. The study uses the Kerala Migration Survey to create a profile of return migrants to the state. The reintegration process has been analysed using semi-structured interviews with government officials and returnees followed by the analysis of policy documents. \n\nThe basic profiling of return migrants clearly shows that a majority of them are unskilled and semi-skilled workers returning due to loss of job because of ongoing recession and nationalisation policies in Gulf countries. The poor savings rate of return migrants, and lack of employment opportunities in the state, show that reintegration of return migrants would not happen without the support of the state. Even though Kerala has a well-developed migration management system compared to other Indian states, it is not enough to meet the demands of return migrants. \n\nThe paper urges the national government to create a comprehensive framework for return migrants by collaborating with state governments, which involves effective management of the skills earned by migrants in the host country, and long-term financial assistance for reintegration."

    "abstract": "Social identities play a critical role in the various phases of conflict. Existing literature often examines the role of social identity of groups in inducing conflict in heterogeneous societies. This article puts forward the view that the role of identity is not limited in terms of inducing conflict, but it also plays a vital role in influencing the dynamics of conflict. Based on this conceptual framework, the article outlines the conflict dynamics observable in the Kannan Devan Hills village in Kerala, where several factors, over the course of time in the last century, have led to the perception of conflict between the Tamils and the Malayalis. As a major objective, the article identifies the issues and processes of social interaction between the two groups that necessarily influence the nature of the conflict. The article identifies that the conflict between the two communities, though mostly latent, can be seen through three important aspects: assertion, negotiation and subjugation of identities. Through assertion of identity, the conflict is perceived over ethnic lines, whereas the process of negotiation and subjugation of identity constantly undermines the ethnic nature of conflict to specific grievances, thus giving insight into the dynamic nature of the conflict."

The Polanyan notion of countermovement (1944) is used to unearth Kerala’s agrarian crisis of the 1990s that stemmed up from the commoditisation of agriculture, which ultimately paved way for an agrarian countermovement in the form of organic farming in the late 20th century. It is argued that organic agriculture signals the emergence of an agrarian counter-discourse promoting greater engagement of the farmers from the fringes. The primary data for the article were gathered out of two empirical projects carried out in 2015–2016."

However, such internal labour migration within India remains largely unstudied and offers huge scope for gaining significant new knowledge. Focusing particularly on migrant construction workers from West Bengal moving to Kerala, this article specifically examines the motivations of these migrants and the role of social networks in the development of such migration streams. A field survey in Kerala indicates that Kerala’s Gulf connection and rapid demographic transition have resulted in significant reduction of local supplies of labour, thus attracting more migrants from other states in India due to better job opportunities, higher wages and good payment systems. Networks within migrant groups, especially friends’ contacts, are found to be the strongest factor in supporting this migration process."

    "abstract": "A double burden of malnutrition (DBM) is the coexistence of under-nutrition and over-nutrition in a single household that has been reported from many developing countries. \n\nWe performed a secondary analysis on the India Human Development Survey (IHDS-II) data assessing ‘stunted child and overweight/obese mother (SCOWT) pairs’ in Kerala households. \n\nWe included 344 pairs of children below 5 years of age and their mothers, with anthropometric measurements. We also performed the Pearson’s Chi–square test to study the association of SCOWT pairs with socio-economic variables. \n\nThe prevalence of SCOWT pairs was 10.7% for Kerala. The bivariate analysis showed no significant association for SCOWT pairs, irrespective of their socio-economic status. \n\nIt is clear that the DBM is prevalent in Kerala and cannot be addressed exclusively by policies focusing on over-nutrition."

The digital revolution towards the end of the last century has spurred a local film practice in northern Kerala, usually called ‘Home Cinema’, ‘home video’, ‘home film’, and so on. \n\nHome Cinema of Kerala is locally produced low-quality CD/DVD video productions which are full-length feature films distributed through video shops, stationery shops, bookstores and so on. Home Cinema, synonymous in its beginning with the films of Salam Kodiyathur, began as an attempt to oppose what was perceived as the immoral qualities of mainstream cinema, both global and regional. \n\nAs a counter to the mainstream, Kodiyathur attempted to formulate Islamic cinema but in the idiom of a strand of mainstream Malayalam cinema. This article looks at the constitution of the Islamic subjects of these cinemas as negotiating the figure of the migrant Muslim in the dominant idiom of Malayalam cinema."

In addition to correspondence between engineers and administrators, the paper relies on the proposals submitted by colonial engineers to the Government of Travancore between 1882 and 1923 to illustrate the process of conception and introduction of the modern water supply system in Thiruvananthapuram. \n\nThe continued focus on replicating this ideal, without any meaningful engagement with the local social and environmental context, partially explains the prevailing inequitable access to service provision and the acute public financial constraints faced by India’s small and medium towns."

Communists have started wearing red dhoti in private and public life recently, to counter the rampant visibility of saffron dhoti, which signifies Hindu religious identity in a shared meaning that exists in villages across north Kerala, and the same dhoti has also turned as the symbol of right-wing Hindu political parties, the political rival of the Communist party in the state. \n\nEarlier, the saffron dhoti was very popular among Hindus in Kerala, without any political differences—liberal Hindus, right-wing political Hindus, secular Hindus, and communist Hindus used to wear the saffron dhoti in public life, and to an extent, the saffron dhoti had become a crucial part of the religious piety of Hindu men and a religious symbol of mobility among Hindus. \n\nThrough understanding the process of making meaning and other apparatus for political mobilisation, this article argues that the ideological differences between right-wing Hindu nationalist organisations and Communist party do not exist at microlevel village politics, where there is a crucial similarity between political parties in mobilising people and other activities of politics in a social democratic system."

With more than three-fourths of colleges under private managements, only Kerala, in India, manages to keep at bay the pressure by the unaided private managements for a free run in education and higher education, which, with its relatively inexorable propensity to privatisation and commercialisation, significantly damages its equity. The Kerala State Higher Education Council, established in 2007, has been a touchstone of this policy ethos to unremittingly sustain equity, access, and excellence through state control."

However, regarding higher education, the state displays less impressive development. The article first provides a brief overview of Kerala’s school education scenario as a base for higher education and then examines issues of access and equity related to higher education in Kerala. The findings suggest that four socio-economically backward northern districts of the state, partly facing a vicious circle of poverty and illiteracy, appear to be responsible for holding the entire state back in the rankings of present development indicators. A set of recommendations to strengthen the access and equity pillars of higher education in Kerala concludes this article, together with some comments on the relevance of vocational rather than purely academic education."

The negative impacts resulting from those synergistic interactions are threatening coastal and marine ecosystems and the many goods and services they provide. This is particularly pervasive in the coastal zone of the Indian subcontinent. \n\nIndia is already experiencing severe climate change impacts, which are projected to worsen in the future. At the same time, the country is gripped by a litter crisis that is overwhelming authorities and communities and hindering the country's sustainable development goals. \n\nThe coastal environment and communities of the southern states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. While these state governments and authorities are stepping up efforts to improve the management of their coastal zones, the scale and severity of these issues are mounting. \n\nHere we review the combined effects of climate change and marine litter pollution in Southern India, focusing on the Gulf of Mannar Reserve in Tamil Nadu and the Malabar Coast in Kerala. Finally, we discuss effective management options that could help improve resilience and sustainability."

    "abstract": "Fake news has become a major challenge for online platforms and society as a whole, with potentially harmful consequences for individuals and organisations. While there has been a lot of research on detecting fake news in high-resource languages, very little attention has been paid to low-resource languages. Due to a lack of corpora and annotated data, the classification of fake news in low-resource languages remains in its infancy. \n\nIn this research, we present a novel transfer learning strategy for detecting fake news in Dravidian languages [including Malayalam]. We introduced a Dravidian_Fake a new dataset for fake news classification in Dravidian languages, and we created multilingual datasets by combining the English ISOT with the Dravidian_Fake datasets. We fine-tuned the mBERT and XLM-R pretrained transformer models with adaptive learning using English and Dravidian language fake news datasets. \n\nThe classification model is evaluated using transfer learning, and the suggested model outperforms current approaches and provides a viable solution for sentence-level fake news classification in a resource-constrained environment. \n\nExperimental results on a Dravidian fake news dataset of low-resource languages demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in detecting fake news with an average accuracy of 93.31 percent in multilingual transfer learning."

    "abstract": "Liturgical prayers comprise a myriad of moral concepts. This is obvious in the anaphora of Addai and Mari, one of the earliest liturgies in the East Syrian tradition. Prayers of this anaphora are a source of Christian moral tradition. \n\nThis article argues that there are fundamental moral concepts, moral values, and special moral cases in the anaphora of Addai and Mari. The prominent moral themes of this anaphora include conscience, justice, love, communion, holiness, gratitude, mercy, peace, and eco-theology. \n\nMoreover, participation in the Holy Qurbana incites moral imagination and subsequently helps one to arrive at good moral decisions. The result is the moral response (counter-gift) of the participation in the Holy Qurbana. \n\nThe article also explores the similarities between the moral concepts of Acts of Thomas, Ephrem's hymns, Aphrahat's Demonstrations and the anaphora of Addai and Mari. This article reasons that a deep relationship exists between liturgy and morality, and one can obtain mature moral perspectives from the anaphora of Addai and Mari in the present context."

    "abstract": "The lack of electoral success of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the South Indian state of Kerala is often explained through the idea of Kerala ‘exceptionalism’, a broad term used to explain the unique historical, political, and developmental trajectory of the state. However, such explanations do not adequately address the systematic and concerted attempts by Hindu nationalist organisations to transform the cultural sphere of Kerala into a fertile ground for its future electoral politics. \n\nThrough an ethnographic study of three Hindu nationalist organisations in the civil society sphere of Kodungallur, a multi-religious town in central Kerala, this article explores the politics and implications of their cultural interventions. \n\nThe article argues that, peeved by an ‘absent Hindu atmosphere’ in Kerala, these organisations are trying to construct new forms of sociality and subjectivity and a grassroots public sphere embedded in Hindu nationalist ideology in Kodungallur. Often described by these organisations as ‘apolitical’ and ‘cultural’, these interventions are indeed a critique of the Kerala public sphere which is characterised by religious pluralism and secular sociality. Hence, the attempt to create a ‘Hindu atmosphere’ by these organisations is a deeply political endeavour aimed at creating an exclusivist Hindu hegemony in the cultural sphere, which they assume will pave the way for their electoral hegemony in Kerala in the long run."

    "abstract": "The advent of Western modernity in India, as a by-product of British colonialism, brought about considerable strain within Indian medical traditions. Indigenous medical traditions which were operating within the broad humoral theory of disease causation came to be subjected to the logic of biomedicine. \n\nBy the late 19th century, as the British in India consolidated their state systems and the princely states modelled their administrative structures in accordance with the British state, there was an increased acceptance of biomedical standards against indigenous medical norms. This was further accentuated by the fear of epidemics, which suggested that diseases spread from person to person and could affect large geographic areas bringing death and suffering in its wake. Disease control and management had, therefore, become a major concern for both the state systems in the British presidencies and in the princely states. \n\nThe prevalence of contagious diseases offered a challenge to reorganise the public health systems of the states, yet they also provided an opportunity to legitimise state sovereignty over the bodies of its subjects. Diseases that were previously seen as localised and situated within culturally-specific locales were now increasingly subjected to the governing mechanisms of the state. \n\nThis paper examines how the medical bureaucratisation of Travancore, in the south-western part of the Indian subcontinent, affected local healthcare traditions in the face of expanding fear of epidemics and ultimately led to the reshaping of indigenous medical systems."

Introducing a detailed review of environmental literature in Malayalam, the selected eco-narratives are presented through two key literary genres: life narratives and novels, conveying the socio-environmental pressures, problems, and anxieties of modern, globalising Kerala. \n\nThis text also entails primary investigations of ‘toxic fictions’ and ‘extractivist fictions,’ including Malayalam novels that narrate the disastrous consequences of the permeation of toxic pollutants in human and ecosystemic bodies, and novels that chronicle the impact of exploitative mining activities on the environment. \n\nAll eco-narratives analysed in the book exhibit the familiar pattern of the Global South environmental narratives, namely, a close imbrication of the ecological and social spheres. <i>Reading Contemporary Environmental Justice</i> argues that these selected eco-texts offer inspiring scenarios where the subaltern people show <i>thantedam</i>, or courage, to claim <i>thante idam</i>, one’s own space in society and on the Earth. \n\nThis volume will be essential for those looking to expand their understanding of environmental justice and the harmful effects of development and modernisation."

    "abstract": "This paper explores British efforts to combat smallpox in Malabar from 1800 to 1900 CE. \n\nDespite intense efforts, smallpox persisted due to fractured state policies, native resistance and public apathy. Epidemics such as smallpox, cholera, malaria, and fevers posed serious threats to British colonial efforts in the Indian subcontinent, hindering colonial expansion. Smallpox, in particular, was prevalent throughout much of the region, including South India, for centuries. \n\nIn Malabar, which was part of the Madras Presidency, the prevalence of smallpox presented significant challenges to the British during their colonial expedition, lasting well into the 20th century. To sustain their rule, the British were compelled to implement several policies to combat the epidemic. British Malabar, one of the districts of Madras Presidency located on India’s western coast, had been rocked by the persistence of contagious diseases in the region. Smallpox caused millions of deaths and was considered one of the most severe and virulent of the diseases, responsible for more victims than all other diseases combined. Survivors often experienced disfigurement, therefore, it held a unique place in Indian and British attitudes towards disease, treatment, and prevention. It was intertwined with religious beliefs and rituals. \n\nHowever, scholarly works on smallpox are limited in Malabar during the British colonial period. Vaccination was considered the most benevolent part of the European medicine under the civilising mission in India."

This discourse simultaneously makes appeal to be dutiful to conventional domestic roles, while being innovative and enterprising in them. Such modes of self-expression, which platforms such as YouTube enable, present conceptual challenges with regard to the categories of the individual and community. \n\nArguing that the videos on these channels complicate the figure of the ‘conventional Muslim woman’ through their constant invocations of modernism and entrepreneurialism, this article illustrates how they produce an Islamic ‘mother community’ virtually. I show how these channels transform into a public yet intimate space, providing an online platform for Muslim women from Kerala to be seen and heard."

    "abstract": "A recent trend has confounded observers of India's political system. Dalits—a population that has historically been deprived of vital resources and socially ostracised by upper-caste Hindus—have increasingly given their vote to the Hindu nationalist movement led by the Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP). Why have some members of India's most marginalised caste come to support a party that has preserved caste hierarchies and catered to the socially dominant sections of society? \n\nThis article explores this question through the case of Kerala, where Dalit support for the BJP is additionally perplexing given the state's history of left-led governments that have implemented far-reaching redistributive reforms that greatly benefited Dalits. Nevertheless, in recent years, the Hindu nationalists have made significant inroads among Kerala's Dalit population. \n\nDrawing on 200 interviews and eight months of ethnography, this article identifies two major factors driving Dalits’ defection to the BJP. The first is linked to the communist parties' (CPs’) agricultural land redistribution programme which, despite being the most ambitious of its kind in modern India, excluded the majority of Dalits and reinscribed caste hierarchies. The second factor is the cultural discrimination Dalits face while working in the CPs, including being grossly underrepresented in the party leadership.  \n\nThe BJP exploits these grievances by providing representation to Dalit cadres who are embedded in strategic majority-Dalit neighborhoods. These cadres win popular support through welfare brokering and also by constructing a new narrative that portrays the CPs as casteist and the BJP as a more socially just alternative for Kerala's Dalits. \n\nThis article makes sense of these findings by drawing on Nancy Fraser's concept of bivalent oppression to advance a novel Gramscian theory of 'bivalent hegemony'."

    "abstract": "In the aftermath of the Kerala floods of 2018, a model village project was proposed in the Kannankund area of Malappuram, Kerala to rehabilitate 34 families who had lost their houses. The project was awarded to a group of technical experts who proposed housing designs that prioritised the aesthetic language of the model village (Roy, 2003). While they engaged in participatory models to establish frameworks for design, the authors of this article observe that the process of participation was largely a smokescreen exercise to 'manipulate' beneficiaries into choosing options that were reflective of the aesthetic values central to the project (Arnstein, 1969; Burawoy, 1979). \n\nBy situating community participation within analytical frameworks of public participation, this article seeks to analyse how skewed power dynamics in beneficiary engagement resulted in circumvention of community needs in the Kannankund model village project. \n\nThe findings of this article hold significance in informing housing and urban planning practices in projects where participatory processes are being invoked to engage with marginalised communities."

    "abstract": "India has been identified as one of the most vulnerable countries within the global climate crisis. Kerala has been highlighted as a hotspot of climate vulnerability within India, and this was illustrated by the floods of 2018. Nearly, 500 people lost their lives during the floods and 1.4 million were displaced, with the reconstruction programme still taking place today. \n\nAnecdotal and media accounts have suggested that the Keralan diaspora played a significant part in the disaster relief and reconstruction effort both during and after the floods. However, there has been very little detailed empirical investigation into this particular diasporic engagement during a time of crisis. \n\nDrawing upon original empirical research, this paper will examine the nature and impact of Keralan diasporic engagement during, and after, the 2018 floods, particularly focussing upon whether this was an inclusive relief and development effort across the categories of caste, region and religion within the state."

They had to navigate the wild flood’s treacherous undercurrents and dive into dirty waters, risking disease and injury. \nSometimes, they had to carry people or act as footstools to help them climb into the boats. They would even swim alongside the boats, so that more people could fit.\nVeteran journalist Rejimon Kuttappan draws on years of friendship with the fisherfolk along the Thiruvananthapuram coast to bring their stories to the world—in their own words.\n  \nThrough interviews with fishermen, government officials, and flood victims, as well as extensive research, he brings to life the daring heroism and heart-wrenching sorrow of those terrible days. \nIn the process, he reveals the precarious lives of the fisherfolk communities—threatened by the climate crisis, coastal erosion and a rapidly changing way of life."

    "abstract": "Despite years of social mobility, indigenous people in India stand low in most development indices, and the substandard living conditions make them highly vulnerable to natural disasters. In this communication, we unfold the vulnerabilities and coping strategies of the Paniya tribal community of Kerala during the unusual rain and flood that the state faced in 2018 and 2019. The vulnerability arises primarily from food scarcity, malnutrition, low physical well-being, unemployment and financial instability. Climate change and related events seem to heighten the prevailing exposure of the indigenous community, and women are generally more vulnerable to the impacts of natural disasters. The study also points out the psychological impact of the flood and the various coping mechanisms adopted over individual and community levels to alleviate the effect. The community members have an optimistic outlook towards life, even after experiencing catastrophic floods and landslides. Nevertheless, this outlook is not a visionary outcome of the rehabilitation process but rather an optionless strategy for the community to get along."

The emerging irrational tendencies undercut the inherent values of democracy, such as tolerance, pluralism, and dissent which further strengthen the instrumental values where security become the essential ingredient. The irrational values are further strengthened when the regimes become more authoritarian clinching on the strength of numerical majority in the legislature (parliamentary majority). Democracy was legitimised to promote dogma and superstitions in the society."

    "abstract": "In the last three decades, millions of people in India have been impacted by floods, losing billions of dollars in damages. Structural and non-structural flood risk management measures have been adopted abundantly. Yet the damage, although reduced, remains great. \n\nAny examination of flood risk management, across a particular geography at any given time, needs to address questions of constraints and power dynamics, that inevitably characterise every decision by each stakeholder involved. An examination of the highly flood-prone state of Kerala, with consecutive floods in the last five years, enables identification of intricate power relations among governments, scientific communities making recommendations, commercial lobbies, political and religious leaders, local influencers and flood-affected communities. \n\nThe research involves a qualitative methodology with repeated data triangulation across different sources and presents a vivid picture of how policy implementation had been paralysed for years, with scientific recommendations to government bodies being diluted and devalued. To address the existing knowledge gap of understanding decision-making in flood risk management through contextualised power relations and constraints, a hybridisation of power theories and bounded rationality was conducted, developing a framework of Power-Bounded Rationality. \n\nThe paper identifies how the widely publicised narratives on threatened local livelihoods led to institutional inaction and ultimately, dilution and devaluation of scientific recommendations, resulting in paralysis."

    "abstract": "This essay argues that Arundhati Roy’s inclusion of numerous Indian vernacular words and phrases in her fiction is carefully calibrated to serve the author’s activist political agenda. This is true not only of her first novel, The God of Small Things, but also of the more recent Ministry of Utmost Happiness. Both feature a Bakhtinian or dialogic interplay of linguistic modes. The earlier work poses two languages against each other: Malayalam, the primary language of Kerala, and English, the medium of narration and the preferred tongue of the prominent Ipe family. The outcome of this contest highlights the Ipes’ imprisonment within a life-denying straitjacket of outworn prejudices and conventions. In The Ministry of Utmost Happiness the linguistic terrain broadens to include several tongues of the subcontinent, along with English. Roy gives special exposure to two: Urdu and Kashmiri, to reclaim them from the oppression both of them, along with their speakers, are undergoing at the hands of the dominant Hindi-speaking majority. Tilo, a pivotal character, is enthusiastically polyglot, a trait which accords with her more general adaptability and freedom from sectarian narrowness. The other central figure, the transgender Anjum, resembles Tilo in her resistance to strict definitions of her fluid selfhood, but must endure forms of verbal as well as physical violence. Like her first novel, but on a more capacious stage, Roy’s second aims at speaking multilingual truth to monolingual power."

This chapter examines the consolidation of right-wing, Hindu religious politics in Kerala against the backdrop of the growing political visibility of the right-wing forces and their social base of mobilisation.\n\nThe growth of Hindu right-wing parties in Kerala is explained with reference to politics around Hindu temples in the state and the Left’s political efforts to check it in various ways. The chapter also critically examines the efforts of the Left in engaging with the identity politics of Hindu religion. It broadly looks at how this engagement is helpful for the parliamentary parties of the Left to bring out a cross-religious mobilisation of classes for common struggle.\n\nThe chapter examines the following questions:\n\n1. How does the transformation of temples from being sites of production and ritualistic authority (to control a caste-ridden society) to devotional centres become meaningful to the political Left and Right in Kerala?\n\n2. How have the Leftist political parties engaged with the idea of ‘wounded Hindu self’ propagated by Hindu right-wing organisations?\n\n3. How have the Left countered the Sangh Parivar through engaging in temple administrative reforms from above and below?"

    "abstract": "Artisanal cultures of work and skills transmission provide a useful point of contrast from which to think about the renewed interest in skills development as a formal, institutionalized process of training and certification for discrete and standardized skills. This article traces the transformation of practices of skill in the context of technological change in the artisanal fisheries of Kanyakumari, Tamil Nadu, to explore a set of linked questions about skills and work: How expansively or narrowly should skills be understood? What can we learn from traditional modes of skills transmission? As technology makes redundant many of the traditional skills, are we seeing a ?degradation? of work? A focus on fishing, a traditionally caste-bound occupation, also opens up questions regarding the work that skills do within a political economy, both in reproducing a given social order, and in enabling change. In tracing processes of labour recruitment in the mechanized fisheries, the article offers a further reflection, about the extent to which skills matter in securing employment, given the continued importance of networks of caste, kinship and village-based community."

    "abstract": "This article, based on fieldwork, discusses the negative impacts of land alienation suffered by Adivasis in Attappady, a tribal block of Kerala in South India. Experiencing multiple alienations that have fundamentally affected their way of life, agricultural practices and food culture, tribals not only continue to suffer discriminatory treatment by non-tribal settlers, but also by state authorities? restrictions of access to local forests and forest produce. These problems assume added significance as this ecologically important location in the Western Ghats of India is one of the eight ?hottest hotspots? of biological diversity in the world, while the traditional guardians of this environment have been completely disempowered. The article traces abuses of power in land alienation processes, analyses unequal power structures and argues that better appreciation of traditional tribal culture and its ecologically holistic approaches ought to inform policies for local sustainable development. This would help the tribals to safeguard their identity within the constraints of current conditions and enhance the prospects for sustainable preservation of the precious local natural resources and biodiversity."

In this study, we explored facilitators, barriers, and cultural context to tobacco cessation among acute coronary syndrome (ACS, or heart attack) patients and providers in a tertiary care institution in the south Indian state of Kerala, with a focus on patient trajectories. Patients who quit tobacco after ACS expressed greater understanding about the link between tobacco and ACS, exerted more willpower at the time of discharge, and held less fatalistic beliefs about their health compared to those who continued tobacco use. The former were motivated by the fear of recurrent ACS, strong advice to quit from providers, and determination to survive and financially provide for their families. Systemic barriers included inadequate training, infrequent prescription of cessation pharmacotherapy, lack of ancillary staff to deliver counseling, and stigma against mental health services."

A dearth of robust and methodologically sound studies has resulted in ambiguity regarding the extent of child abuse in the general population.\nObjectives\nTo estimate the one-year and lifelong prevalence of exposure to violence, physical abuse, emotional abuse, sexual abuse, and neglect using a validated instrument—the International Society for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect (ISPCAN) Child Abuse Screening Tool – Child, Home Version (ICAST-CH). Participants and Setting: Adolescents (n = 6957) attending randomly selected schools in one city in Kerala, India.\nMethods\nCross-sectional survey using self-report instrument.\nResults\nThe one-year prevalence of any abuse was 89.9% (95% CI: 89.1–90.7) suggesting that child maltreatment was widespread. Physical and emotional abuses were also very common. Although sexual abuse was least common, a considerable proportion of adolescents reported it; one-year prevalence of sexual abuse was 16.7% and lifetime prevalence was 19.9%. Boys reported more abuse than girls across all the categories of abuse (including sexual abuse). Abuse was more frequent in the higher age groups and classes at school. Abuse was also more frequent in nuclear families and families that reported alcohol use. Children who reported an abusive experience usually faced more than one category of abuse; abuse in one category was significantly associated with abuse in other categories.\nConclusions\nAbuse of children is alarmingly common. There is an urgent need for improving the awareness surrounding this issue as it is a major public health challenge faced by the country. The priority should be on setting up easily accessible support services for children."

The earnings inequality between men and women has been increasing, even though their wage grows faster than men’s wage. The indices of inequality suggest the growing wage disparity in the regular and casual labour market. The result reveals that the levels of education and earnings are positively correlated, but women with the same level of education earn much less than men in regular salaried work. The rising wage inequality of men and women during 2004–2009 were associated with the growth rate of wages in the same period. That is, the wage rates of both regular and casual workers have increased more than four per cent during the period that experienced the highest inequality."

    "abstract": "This article analyses the super-hit Malayalam film Drishyam (Sight) in relation to the modalities of protest in the Chumbanasamaram (Kiss of Love [KoL] campaign) in 2014 in Kerala in which the kiss was deployed as a form of public protest. It brings together a popular thriller and a political protest that made waves in the entire nation in order to explore how shifting media technologies choreograph performative modes of doing politics. Drishyam stages the convergence of different media forms and legitimises the conventions of older forms such as cinema that hinges on the spectacle of women's bodies and sexual acts on screen. At the same time, digital technology and the modes of circulation and reception it facilitates function as a node of heightened anxiety. Although Drishyam precedes the KoL campaign, this film can be seen as a response to precisely the (hyper) visibility of bodies and sexuality in the public domain through the workings of new media technologies. The film is driven by an overwhelming concern about the public performance of intimacy–contiguous with the secret filming and the threat of circulation of the naked woman's body that is the cause of crisis in the film. Thus, I argue that the energies that drive Drishyam and finds a resonance with a national audience, in fact, anticipates KoL-type display of sexuality which is at once unauthorised and out of place but also mediated by unruly technologies."

Despite the differences in water users’ associations in terms of genesis and self-reliance, many are seeking state support for sustaining the systems. In obtaining state support, associations that are capable of adapting to new decentralised institutional arrangements appear better-positioned, compared to those that lack such capabilities."

This incongruence is puzzling since elections to both levels of government, federal and state, are based on the single-member simple plurality electoral system and the territorial boundaries of the state, and therefore the societal environment remains constant. This article argues that this incongruence is not merely the product of the federal parliamentary structure of the polity, electoral rules, and socio-economic factors but because of what parties do. This article gives agency to parties and brings party strategy to the centre of the analysis."

Whatever is published does not receive the wide circulation it deserves. Some of the reluctance to disperse collected information is caused by self-imposed restrictions to ensure the security of the followers of Jesus and to protect their worship sites."

Thriving as marginal spaces in the overcrowded Indian cities, coastal towns, and villages, these African sacred topographies are continuously reimagined and reinvented by invested stakeholders to suit contemporary purposes. While addressing the complex connections of some of these sacredscapes with the African Indian Ocean slave trade, this paper examines how shrines dedicated to African Sufi saints and spirits keep African memories alive as devotees continue to seek the intercessions of these saints and spectral deities. By studying the spiritual beliefs and practices at these shrines, I discuss how African sacred geography in India prevails as a relational space connected to the Indian Ocean littoral through the intercessory powers of the African saints and spirits."

This study shows that vagabonds use different regimes of worth and justification to resist domination and to shape their cultural encounters with host and home cultures. It explains how existing acculturation research lacks insights about worth and regimes of justification that hinder it from fully understanding the role of domination and cultural experiences of subalterns."

    "abstract": "Ponnani was a port in southwestern India that resisted the Portuguese incursions in the sixteenth century through the active involvement of religious, mercantile and military elites. In the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries Ponnani was the only place where the Dutch East India Company had commercial access into the kingdom of the Zamorins of Calicut. When the Dutch gained prominence in the coastal belt, this port town became the main centre for their commercial, diplomatic, and political transactions. But as a religious centre it began to recede into oblivion in the larger Indian Ocean and Islamic scholarly networks. The present article examines this dual process and suggests important reasons for the transformations. It argues that the port town became crucial for diplomatic and economic interests of the Dutch East India Company and the Zamorins, whereas its Muslim population became more parochial as they engaged with themselves than with the larger socio-political and scholarly networks."

    "abstract": "This article analyses the early-20th-century Malayalam women’s magazines of Kerala in terms of their politics of representation. These magazines emerged at a time when Kerala was on the cusp of modernity and catered to Malayalee women with the aim of transforming them into “ideal gendered selves”. However, the contributions of these magazines, managed and edited mostly by the early feminists of Kerala, are seldom acknowledged or remembered within the larger discourse of Kerala’s colonial modernity. The magazines can be viewed as principal sites which recorded the responses of the emergent modern Malayalee community, particularly its women, to the notion of the “ideal Malayalee woman”. This article explores the entrenched patriarchal ideology and caste–class nexus that informed the content of these publications, and reveals the politics inherent in their seemingly apolitical stance."

    "abstract": "The Nambudiri Brahmins of the South Indian state of Kerala transmit what may be the oldest surviving musical culture in South Asia, a fixed oral tradition of sacred songs used in ritual (Sāmaveda). Without recourse to written notation, Nambudiri practitioners teach songs face-to-face, using their voices and a distinctive system of hand gestures to convey melodies to their students. \n\nThis embodied transmission of knowledge is further shaped by hereditary and social requirements that dictate who may teach, who may learn, and in what circumstances. As a result of such strict norms for teaching, and under the pressure of broader social changes, Nambudiri Sāmaveda in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries has declined to the point where only a single active line of normative transmission exists. This article presents a case study of the close bond and evolving pedagogical relationship between the aging _guru_ (teacher) and student involved in this unique transmission, highlighting the integration of digital technology into their lessons, and examining the impact of this innovation on textual, pedagogical, and ritual authority. The *digital guru*—in the form of an archive of audio- and video-recordings—aids recall and restores a sense of authority to the transmission of Sāmaveda, and yet the living guruis ultimately a presence that cannot be replaced."

    "abstract": "This paper is a preliminary attempt to understand globalisation and social transformation in rural Kerala. It studies the socio-economic changes in a village (Kavakad) in the midland region of Kerala, to trace how determinants of change are historically shaped. The paper triangulates quantitative data, qualitative materials from fieldwork, and historical sources to understand social transformation.\n\nIt focuses on the historical trajectories of mobility (spatial, educational, and occupational) of three communities (Syrian Christians, Ezhavas, and Pulayas) in the village. The shaping of the locality and its development trajectory are entrenched in the power dynamics of land ownership (between the Pulaya and Syrian Christian communities), which facilitated Syrian Christian dominance in the development process. The Syrian Christians were the locus of 20th-century socio-economic transition in the village.\n\nWhile the well-endowed Syrian Christians gained immensely from transnational connections, new ways opened up for the Pulaya–Dalit community through the political decentralisation of the 1990s. At present, despite enhanced mobility in all communities, social inequalities persist in the village.\n\nThe paper concludes that market-led processes of globalisation and transnationalism benefit dominant communities, but only local, political interventions are pivotal for the development of marginalised communities."

    "abstract": "The chapter is a sustained textual analysis of one of contemporary India’s most critically acclaimed novels: K.R. Meera’s The Gospel of Yudas (Penguin/Hamish Hamilton, 2016). The novel is set in the southern Indian state of Kerala, which has a coastline of 590 kilometers and inland water spread of around 4 lakh hectares. Much of environmental communication in Kerala (densely populated at over 30 million) has revolved around the trope of water: there has historically been a close association of various life forms, including the human, with the ecology of various water bodies. The Gospel of Yudas echoes the centrality of this “aquatic ecology” in its narrative about a former Naxalite (political revolutionary) whose guilt over betraying his colleagues during police interrogation leads to a tortured nomadic life of dredging up corpses from lakes and rivers. This chapter makes an argument to read The Gospel of Yudas as a postcolonial text that engages with the fields of ecocriticism and environmental communication, as the narrative simultaneously and powerfully negotiates both state violence and ecological degradation."

The economic reforms led to a gradual withdrawal of state from agriculture that happened in various forms, such as declining public expenditure and increasing marketisation of agrarian sector. The process of liberalisation in fact proved more disastrous for agriculture and peasantry in India because it was adopted without resolving the fundamental agrarian problems like inegalitarian land structure, depeasantisation, and abysmal condition of agricultural labour, tenants, and small peasants. The\ndecline has resulted in worsening state of welfare of people dependent on agriculture, directly or indirectly. \n\nThis paper, therefore, makes an attempt to trace the growth and problems of agriculture during the reforms period and to find ways and means of resolving the present crisis with special reference to Kerala."

    "abstract": "This article constructs explanatory theory on trust in e-voting, a term that refers to the use of stand-alone IT artefacts in voting stations. We study e-voting as a techno-organisational arrangement embedded in the process of elections and the broader socio-economic context of a country. Following a critical realist approach, we apply retroduction and retrodiction principles to build theory by complementing existing studies of e-voting with insights from an in-depth case study of elections in India. \n\nFirst, we seek evidence of trust in e-voting in the responses of the public to the announcement of election results. Then we derive the following four mechanisms of trust creation or loss: the association of e-voting with the production of positive democratic effects; the making of e-voting part of the mission and identity of electoral authorities; the cultivation of a positive public attitude to IT with policies for IT-driven socio-economic development; and, in countries with turbulent political cultures, a clear distinction between the experience of voting as orderly and experiences of malpractice in other election tasks. We suggest that these mechanisms explain the different experience with e-voting of different countries. \n\nAttention to them helps in assessing the potential of electoral technologies in countries that are currently adopting them, especially fragile democracies embarking upon e-voting."

    "abstract": "This case study describes a qualitative study conducted in India as an outsider (foreigner) investigating managerial leadership competencies of Heads of Departments in higher education institutions in the state of Kerala. The research contributed to a better understanding of how Western views of managerial leadership competencies can be applied in a non-Western context. A description of the research undertaken is presented including a description of the area of interest of the researcher. The research case study approach is described as well as specific issues to do with qualitative study. Data collection and analysis as well as limitations of the study are considered. Dealing with practical considerations is a key to any successful research and in the case study, they were identified as lack of access to networks, logistics to do with travel and accommodation, and difficulties in the collection of data during site visits. This case study also provides a reflection on how well the research was conducted and identification of issues. Some of the key points raised are practicalities, the lack of secondary data, and the role of the researcher as an “outsider.” These are discussed further in the section on lessons learned. Four lessons are emphasized: the need to understand the culture in which the research is being conducted, the benefits and issues of being an outsider and the need to minimize “outsider-ness,” the importance of preparation and planning, and the use of pilot interviews and a reflective diary as part of the research process."

    "abstract": "Discussions on development and deprivation, unequivocally place the category of female-headed households  (FHHs) in the forefront. The argument of feminisation of poverty cites the proliferation of FHHs as a valid reason for the increasing burden of poverty amongst women in the world. This can be examined by analysing the deprivation status of FHHs in comparison to the general population and marginalised population (Scheduled Tribes -STs). \n\nPoor women within marginalised and socially excluded groups are prone to double discrimination. The possibility of double discrimination of FHHs can be investigated by comparing the FHHs within a marginalised group, as the STs with its general population counterpart. The deprivation analysis in this paper is based on the criteria adopted by the Socio Economic Caste Census as well as the data from Census of India. \n\nThe paper attempts to comprehend the deprivation status of FHHs, by\ncomparing data of ST households and households belonging to general population separately."

    "abstract": "Migration has become a worldwide phenomenon in the 21st century. Migratory tendencies have been inherent in the context of Kerala, and it has been shaping the economic and social situation. The economic boom within the Gulf countries gave migration a considerable boost, reaching its peak in terms of both numbers and remittances. Ironically, Kerala, of late, is witnessing a reverse migration of labour.\n\nThe Kerala Migration Survey (KMS) 2018 is the eighth in the series of studies on migration undertaken by the Centre for Development Studies (CDS) since 1998. The 2018 report sheds light on the various issues concerning migration and mobility. It gathers the fruit of two decades of research done at CDS and examines migration dynamics from demographic, economic, and sociopolitical perspectives.\n\nThe basic objectives of the survey are similar to earlier surveys in the series: to estimate migrants from Kerala to various destinations and vice-versa, their demographic and socio-economic characteristics, and to estimate remittances to Kerala. The report also postulates factors responsible for the fall of emigration from Kerala. The information given in the report is based on a large-scale sample survey of 15,000 households.\n\nAccording to the study, there are 2.1 million emigrants from Kerala across the world, of which 15.8 per cent are females. However, there is a reduction of 3 lakhs emigrants during 2013-18, which is one-tenth of the 2013 emigrants. The estimated total remittances to Kerala is Rs.85,092 crores, and remittances to the state have increased. This is due to the fact that Keralites in the Gulf have climbed the social ladder and earn higher wages, allowing them to remit more."

    "abstract": "This paper interprets the context and implications of a little-known but consequential ideological feud that emerged between rival “regionalist” and “modernist” camps of architectural practitioners in the south Indian state of Kerala in the 1970s. \n\nBeginning with a comparative analysis of the private residences of the key protagonists—the expatriate British Gandhian, Laurie Baker, and J. C. Alexander, an influential modernist and doyen of the architectural profession in post-independence Kerala—the paper explores the contrasting views of both camps as they debated the idea of the modern house. \n\nTurning to the architectural historiography of modern India, the over-representation of one camp and the relative invisibility of the other is then examined in the context of the radical cultural and political climate of the 1970s in Kerala. The paper considers how Baker’s rise to wider recognition and impact by the end of the 1970s can be understood only by understanding the “author function” that Baker satisfied in Kerala society. \n\nThe paper concludes that the complex network of influences and actors that appear in this specific case study, drawn from the assumed margins of India’s modern architectural history, makes the case for a flatter ontology of history, rejecting the existing “diffusion” model and enabling buildings and context to speak in equal measure."

The scope of the study is limited to understanding the critical aspects that are related to the teacher’s work within the classroom. The paper analyses the theoretical arguments that are relevant to critical pedagogy in relation to teachers’ practices as they emerged during the study. \n\nThe study, conducted in the South Indian state of Kerala, reveals that teacher subjectivity and schooling situations interact in a dialectical fashion to shape the nature of classroom teaching. The political subjectivity of the teachers, shaped by their close interaction with the Kerala Science Literature Movement (KSSP) makes their pedagogy critical in nature. On the other hand, the standardised curriculum and mechanically disciplined school environment continuously challenge the teachers’ efforts at being critical in their work."

The paper discusses women’s survival strategies in the face of growing competition in the vending business and examines their implications for women’s engagement in collective action for improved work conditions and the rights of artisanal fish workers."

    "abstract": "The decades of collective victimhood and trauma that the oppressed lower caste members in the southern state of India (Kerala) suffered in silence were less known to the world until the socio-religious reform movements offered a space for their collective expression of agitation and unrest. With no socially sanctioned channels to express their injustice and pain, the folk ritual of Theyyam often became the alternative for a cathartic release of transgenerational and collective victimhood and trauma long endured by people belonging to these communities. \n\nA common theme of Theyyam discussed in literature is the symbolic meaning of ‘empowerment’, ‘dissent’ and ‘protest’ that Theyyam takes on as the performer embodies a chosen deity. The ritual thereby becomes a temporary outlet for the collective rage, anger and resentment endured by people of the oppressed communities over the years. These insights have implied the healing potential of Theyyam as it offers a safe outlet for repressed trauma reactions for individuals as well as for the community, collectively. However, what is relevant to this discussion is the mechanism by which healing processes are activated in Theyyam. This article makes an effort in this direction—the focus is on understanding Theyyam as a psycho-cultural phenomenon and the collective therapeutic dynamics that it offers."

    "abstract": "The poetry emanating from the Bhakti tradition of devotional love in India has been both a religious expression and a form of resistance to hierarchies of caste, gender, and colonialism. Some scholars have read this art form through the lens of resistance and reform, but others have responded that imposing an interpretive framework on these poems fails to appreciate their authentic expressions of devotion. This book argues that these declarations of love and piety can simultaneously represent efforts towards emancipation at the spiritual, political, and social levels.\n\nThis book, through a close study of <i>Nalini</i> (1911), a Malayalam lyric poem, as well as other poems authored by Mahakavi Kumaran Asan (1873–1924), a low-caste poet, demonstrates how Asan employed a theme of love among humans during the modern period in Kerala that was grounded in the native South Indian Bhakti understanding of love of the deity. Asan believed that personal religious freedom comes from devotion to the deity, and that love for humans must emanate from love of the deity.\n\nIn showing how devotional religious expression also served as a resistance movement, this study provides new perspective on an understudied area of the colonial period. Bringing to light an under-explored medium, in both religious and artistic terms, this book will be of great interest to scholars of religious studies, Hindu studies, and religion and literature, as well as academics with an interest in Indian culture."

The specific instance of the proposed Athirappilly HEPP is discussed against the background of the opposition of environmentalists and other sympathetic associations. \n\nThe strong opposition to HEPPs in specific local contexts has led to increased emissions in other places. The tenets of Energy Justice – distributional, procedural, recognition and cosmopolitan – have been challenged by the environmentalists’ movement against the Athirappilly HEPP. \n\nThe inherent conflicts between Environment Law and Climate Law on the one hand and the principles of Energy Justice and Law on the other are pointed out. The concept of “Power-Environ” is introduced and characterised, and its relation to Energy Justice and Law is explored in the policy context. \n\nThe concept proposed here serves as a foundation for realizing parsimonious and effective representation of the opposition to HEPPs, and ushering Energy Justice and Law. The use of this concept, as an integrated whole founded on the principles of Energy Justice and Law, should facilitate balanced policy-making in the Energy sector, especially in India and hopefully across the world too."

The resulting ambiguity presents an opportunity to explore a problem that has troubled the recent ethical turn in anthropology: how do we know ethics when we see it? \n\nAnalysing seemingly ethicalising moves during an environmental awareness campaign, I show how ambiguous evaluations can become persistent demands to account for one’s actions, even for those who protest, transgress, mock, or otherwise resist them. \n\nThis process sheds light on the limits of freedom in ethical life and, thus, contributes to debates on how to define ethics for the purposes of anthropological research."

The study describes alternative modes of fishery credit delivery in the State and explores the tangled inter-linkages in the formal and informal credit contracts. \n\nFurther, empirical assessment of borrowing pattern of small-scale fishers is conducted by taking the case of ring seiners who constitute an important segment in the local fishery. The main determinants of their borrowing behaviour from institutional credit sources are identified using a fractional logit regression approach. \n\nThe findings point to continuing dominance of the informal financial sector over the institutional credit sector. In the light of the findings, measures such as reforming the fish auction system, linking insurance with formal credit, further strengthening of fishery co-operative societies and exercising stringent state control to curb exploitative lending practices are suggested."

The Kerala Model and the politically triggered society of the state, with its strong Marxist party, alienated women and overlooked women’s work, according to feminist critique. This paper seeks to ascertain the unique kind of feminism in Kerala under such prevailing social conditions."

    "abstract": "This paper examines masculinity, migration, and the changing occupational status of nursing through the lens of therapeutic mobilities; health related mobilities of people (nurses) and products (credentials). \n\nIndian men have become increasingly interested in nursing as a career, and this interest is strongly associated with the profession’s international motility—its mobility potential. The research reported in this paper traces the migration trajectory across time (2008–2016) and over space (India to Canada) and reveals an overrepresentation of male nurses in international migration contexts (Canada), compared to the Indian context. \n\nMale nurses also disproportionally benefit from these mobilities in terms of their occupational success post-migration. Mobilities can be therapeutic for the status of nursing in India, which rises in line with the degree of international motility the profession offers, but gendered distinctions in the outcomes of the migration process illustrate the importance of highlighting uneven mobilities. International mobilities are also deeply implicated in ongoing transformations occurring in the ‘moorings’ of nursing educational, employment and regulatory structures in India."

    "abstract": "The paper will focus on Pottan Teyyam, a ritual healing performance practice in South-Indian state, Keralam, to analyse the complexities of what I call ‘performing disfiguration’. \n\nPottan is one of the major figuration in the repertoire of extremely popular Teyyam practices. The performance is rich in its use of music, spectacle, and movements, and its significance lies in the fact that during its span a lower caste/untouchable transforms into god, often in a state of possession. \n\nThe existing scholarship on Pottan Teyyam is focused on the binary of ‘purity’ and ‘pollution’ which forms the central focus of the caste system that gets criticised in the performance of Teyyam. These perspectives have been gleaned through a focus on the analysis of myth and tottam (songs), with a stress on transformation of a lower caste performer into a divine figure. This paper foregrounds disfiguration in performance as it stages the problematic situation of caste by reading the performance on the basis of relationalities between animal, gender, and disability. \n\nThe word Pottan literally means ‘dumb’ or ‘mute’, and the performance links both negative senses of the word - a disability that indicates foolishness. Over the course of the performance, a single performer’s body gets transformed into three different characters: Pulamarutan enacts an animal trait, Pulapottan performs disability and Pulachamundi brings out the ‘primitive’ nature of a lower caste woman. During these distinct embodiments one can see the complex process of disfiguration manifested in the performance. The performer uses different mukhappala (masks) indicating the character and their lower caste identity. The mukhapala thus indicates the scarring undergone by the character. \n\nHow does this scarring work in, what is otherwise seen as, a divine figure within the social realm? How can ‘performing’ disfiguration help us understand the complex interlinking of caste and disability? Further, how does disfiguration help reflect on deep-rooted stigmas with regards to caste, gender, disability?"

    "abstract": "Drawing on the critique of ideology elaborated by the Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Žižek, in this conceptual paper we rethink responsible tourism. More specifically, in line with Žižek’s argument that ideology is closely linked to reality and not a dreamlike illusion, we reconceptualise the ideological character of responsible tourism. This ideological character, we propose, is fundamentally rooted in real global issues, and often inadvertently and implicitly sustains the mechanism of modern global capitalism. \n\nAlthough responsible tourism has been a powerful unifier among tourism stakeholders, we argue that its critical conceptual considerations have not yet been given sufficient robust reflection. Hence, in this conceptual paper, we rethink responsible tourism through the lens of ideology contributing to further knowledge about this topic. \n\nIn doing so, we analyse two key policy documents: the Cape Town (2002) and Kerala (2008) Declarations from which the term of responsible tourism originated. Following Žižek’s critique of ideology, we aspire to shape more inclusive and effective sustainable and responsible development as advocated by the Sustainable Development Goals and responsible tourism stakeholders. Furthermore, the novel interjection of the Žižekian concept of ideology to the context of responsible tourism opens up new theoretical possibilities for critical tourism studies."

    "abstract": "This essay explores a global and existential problem—how ordinary people live and contend with historically deep subordination, humiliation, and exclusion—through an examination of the everyday lives of formerly untouchable caste Dalit communities in Kerala, India. \n\nI look at this through the lens of neighbourliness: how people discuss how they live together with other castes and classes in small town and rural Kerala. Their continuing struggles with and experiences of humiliation and subordination must be placed within the historical context of Kerala, where deep inequality previously constituted every social relationship, and where the communist movement and other important social and political transformations have radically transformed living conditions and provided new languages and possibilities of equality within the official public sphere, if not the household. \n\nDrawing from the anthropology of ethics and engaging with philosophical discussions of living with others, I scrutinise neighbourliness as an ethical landscape for Dalits living in new kinds of neighbourhoods produced by political and social transformation. In doing so, I also reflect upon the ongoing conversations and interactions within which, for Dalits, respect, dignity, and worth are at stake. \n\nThe essay also suggests new ways of understanding publics that are neither private nor part of the official public, but rather are networks of houses within rural neighbourhoods—what I call ‘private-publics’, which are constituted through gendered caste relations."

    "abstract": "This article focuses on religious pedagogies as an essential part of the practice and the making of modern religion. It takes the case of the Syrian Orthodox communities in Kerala, South India to examine how shifts in pedagogical models and practice have reframed their understanding of knowledge and God. \n\nThe paper highlights two moments of transformation—the nineteenth-century missionary reforms and twenty-first-century Sunday school reforms—that brought ‘old’ and ‘new’ pedagogies into conflict, redefining the modes of knowing and religious subjectivities they presuppose. For this I draw from historical and pedagogical materials, and ethnographic fieldwork in churches and Sunday schools. \n\nThe paper diverges from widespread narratives on the missionary encounter by showing how colonial efforts to replace ritual pedagogies with modern schooling were channelled into a textbook culture that remained close to Orthodox ritualism. The ‘new’ pedagogy turned learning into a ritualised practice that continued to emphasise correct performance over interiorised belief. \n\nContrasting this with today's curriculum revisions, I argue that educational reforms remain a privileged mode of infusing new meanings into religious practice and shaping new orthodoxies, especially under the threat of heterodoxy. This reflects a broader dynamic within Orthodox Christianity that takes moments of crisis or change as opportunities to turn orthopraxy into orthodoxy and renew the faith. \n\nThe paper engages with postcolonial debates on religion, education, and modernity, and points to more pervasive assumptions about what makes Orthodox Christianity and the modes of knowing and ethical formation in Eastern Christianity."

The political actions of multiple actors such as social reform movements, communist movements, public theatre, people’s science movements, library and radical public policy played decisive role in this direction. In contrast to the two dominant conceptions of modernity – western capitalist modernity and eastern socialist modernity, which conceptualised that modernity is the result of industrialisation and centralised planning and development, respectively – modernity in Kerala was the result of political actions from below, which forced the state to adopt radical social and political reforms. These exceptionalities in Kerala modernity distinct itself from rest of the modernities in societies of the Global South."

Macro-changes in fishing and fish marketing in Kerala have forced women fish vendors to travel greater distances and spend long hours away from their homes and communities. In these changed circumstances, this paper examines how local communities exercise social control over women fish workers and the forms of self and peer monitoring and regulation the women fashion in response to the surveillance of their personal and work lives. Women responded to the relentless policing of their lives by generating discourses of ‘good’ and ‘bad’ (vending) women that may be regarded as processes of self and other identity formation that divided women from each other. This ethnographic study primarily uses qualitative research tools."

The determinants of satisfaction in a particular location are comprised of environmental, economic and sociocultural activities. The Sabarimala hill temple is one of the major Sastha temples in India. Every year, about 25 million pilgrims visit the temple from all parts of the country and abroad. The present study analyzes devotee satisfaction according to their demographic profile and identifies key factors that affect the overall satisfaction of pilgrims visiting the temple at the Sabarimala mass gathering destination. A total of 526 visitors were contacted with a prestructured, field tested questionnaire. This was analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences. Factor analysis, regression analysis and two-step cluster analysis were used to elucidate satisfaction parameters. The identified factor groupings for pilgrim satisfaction at Sabarimala destination are food and accommodation, safety and security, health and sanitation, ecology and environment and and communication and transportation. From the analysis of various results of the present study, it is evident that the mass pilgrimage of Sabarimala destination exhibits the signs of a secular experience and its visitors are mainly motivated by spiritual aspects."

Specifically, we identify shifts in economic and political contexts that have permitted these functions to pass from labour contractors to workers-agents and from a Sardari (top-down) to a Ristedari (kinship based) system. Outlining the functions of the labour contractor—as bridge, broker and buffer—the article details the complex processes and the series of negotiations that occur during the transition from labour contractor to worker-agent-led recruitment and the implications of this shift for labour relations in the production setting.

The essay first investigates rural publics, such as rural libraries, and suggests that forms of progressive civility in seemingly caste-free associational publics should be understood not as the elimination of caste practices but their reconstitution. Second, while it is commonly accepted that caste is naturally practised in the ‘private’, I suggest that these ‘privates’ are in fact what I call a ‘private–public’ and are spatially and socially shaped by gender and caste. I argue that ideas of civility and democracy need to understand experiences of forms of civility and incivility as constituted in private–publics rather than only in the formal associational public."

    "abstract": "Comparative law is a fecund field of study capable of yielding insights not obtainable otherwise. It comprises a vital tool not only for academics but also for law and policymakers. It also happens to be a delicate undertaking, and prone to several pitfalls if not approached carefully. \n\nGiven the shared legal and political antecedents of South Asian nations, a South Asia-specific comparative law discourse of at least some measure of robustness ought to have emerged by now. This expectation lies largely frustrated. Scholarly engagement with comparative law is both sporadic and unsatisfactory, the latter attributable to recurring shortcomings such as a tendency to cherry-pick. Such desultoriness is consequential, given comparative law’s capacity to provide inputs to states’ lawmaking and policymaking projects. \n\nIn this paper, I explore a little-known instance, one that involves an initiative of the Indian state of Kerala to reform and codify certain aspects of Islamic personal law. It borrowed considerably from the reform initiatives of Pakistan and Bangladesh but, unusually, chose not to acknowledge this fact. It also deviated from the latter in several crucial respects. And in deviating, it also succeeded in undermining its own stated objectives. \n\nIn this paper, I examine the two initiatives; their similarities and differences; and the implications that these similarities and differences carry, particularly in the light of avoiding pitfalls while doing comparative law."

As is well known, labour migration to the Persian Gulf from Kerala from the 1970s has been a decisive flow that has impacted all aspects of life in the state. Its impact on the family as a procreative unit has, however, been only probed superficially. I argue that the opening of the global job market, combined with other features of contemporary Malayali society, has transformed the very functioning of the nuclear family unit. In feminist politics, global flows have led to the surfacing of several ‘regulative universals’, and these flows take place through a variety of channels. The clash now is no longer between the indigenous and the foreign, but between ‘glocally generated’ hybrids."

    "abstract": "Excerpt: On January 1, 2019, a human chain of women, between three and five million strong and 385 miles long, gathered to protest the barring of menstruating women from entering Sabarimala Temple in Kerala, India. The so-called Women’s Wall received widespread news coverage; in the United States, NPR, the BBC, the Washington Post, and the New York Times all had stories on it. Debra Messing, Kerry Washington, and Rose McGowan tweeted about it. \n\nAs a scholar of caste, gender, and religion in Kerala, India, I watched the news and international attention with a good deal of interest and a bit of unease about how the intersections of casteism and patriarchy (brahmanical patriarchy) were glossed over in the reporting. \n\nThe issues surrounding the Women’s Wall reveal the ways in which certain groups invest in the protection of brahmanical patriarchal power; a power that is reflected in political tensions between the Kerala state and the Indian central government that may come to a head in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. \n\nCasteism and religious divides in Kerala are rarely discussed in depth because Kerala is largely seen as a progressive state, with a 94 percent literacy rate. Other development indicators also point to the assumption that Kerala is exceptional: low infant mortality rates, low maternal mortality rates, low fertility rates, and a population where there are more women than men. Kerala is seen as secular because there is a large number of both Christian and Muslim religious minorities. \n\nIn 1957, Kerala made history by democratically electing a communist government and initiating a set of far-reaching (although not all-encompassing) land distribution policies. The state is seen as transgender friendly with a transgender beauty pageant and support for trans surgery. The “feminist ” Women’s Wall protest fits in quite neatly within the dominant narrative that Kerala is exceptional, progressive, and thus a model for other Indian states and for countries in the Global South to follow. However, even as “progressive” Kerala is celebrated today, it is not clear that women in the state are necessarily as empowered as commonly believed. The state has some of the highest rates of violent crime in the nation and violence against women is widespread. Kerala’s suicide rates are two times the national average, and Kerala leads all other states in India in the number of family murder/suicides. Women are vastly underrepresented in politics. Although women are educated, the female workforce participation rate is one of the lowest in India. There is evidence to suggest that educated, nonworking women are using their education toward securing a better marriage match rather than for employment or empowerment.\n\nKerala has a history of extremely repressive caste practices. This area of India once not only practiced untouchability, but what is known as “distance pollution.” A Dalit (the most oppressed caste in the caste hierarchy) was not allowed within sixty feet of a Brahmin (the most privileged caste), and the mere shadow of a Dalit falling upon a dominant-caste person could result in a Dalit’s death. Dalit Bahujans were prohibited"

    "abstract": "Since the mid-1980s, Kerala has been battling fiscal stress, despite the state’s economy growing faster than the national economy. Moreover, this stress is only getting aggravated, even though Kerala’s tax effort has been recognised as above average. Studying available data with an alternative approach points to the failure of public resource mobilisation as the primary cause of this fiscal stress. The inability to harness the state’s fiscal potential, an incorrect perception about the state’s fiscal situation, and a lack of political will to address the situation have exacerbated the crisis."

    "abstract": "This chapter aims to understand and document the challenges facing Kerala’s labour market and argues for specific industrial and employment policies to meet these challenges. \n\nKerala’s remarkable achievements in the social spheres, including health, education and land reforms, have helped the state’s population achieve a considerable degree of upward social and economic mobility. Kerala’s economy has been growing at fast rates from the late 1980s onwards, aided to a great extent by the remittances sent to the state by Malayalee workers in foreign countries. \n\nHowever, Kerala’s population has now started ageing, and the state’s economy is dependent on migrant workers from other Indian states, especially for manual jobs. At the same time, the creation of high value-adding jobs in Kerala in the services and manufacturing sectors has not been adequate, particularly in comparison with the rate of supply of educated workers in the state. \n\nGiven such a context, Kerala now aims to set up a modern industrial sector that builds on the specific advantages enjoyed by the state with respect to natural resources and people. There is great potential in Kerala for the promotion of food- and agro-based industries; specific segments of chemical, electronic and engineering industries; and also industries based on advanced technologies such as biotechnology, nanotechnology, and life sciences. \n\nThere is also great scope for a revival of entrepreneurship in the state, harnessing, in particular, the energies of the large body of Malayalee engineers and professionals worldwide."

This article examines the case study of a land occupation movement called Chengara struggle in the largest corporate plantation in southern India. \n\nThe movement is led by the historically dispossessed scheduled caste and scheduled tribe communities. The objective of the study is to understand the type of institutional transformation of property rights that the movement is calibrating. Institutional theory is used to determine the nature and direction of transformation using the framework of economic and political transaction costs. \n\nThe article concludes that the central demand of the struggle for individual title deed has higher private gains for right-holders, but has overall negative gains for agricultural productivity. The article concludes that productivity-oriented demands to restructure land-use rights within plantations might converge in the land struggles of the future."

These freedoms, however, are premised on the masculine authority of the police uniform and its associated protections. \n\nThus, while the promise of female empowerment is pivotal to SPC curriculum, the conditional nature of freedom in khaki underscores the ambivalent nature of those curricular promises. The paper concludes by examining the implications of freedom bequeathed through masculine forms of protection for girls’ participation in society."

The 2014 “Kiss of Love” campaign garnered national attention, sparking controversy as images of activists kissing in public and dragged into police vans flooded the media. In <i>Unruly Figures</i>, Navaneetha Mokkil tracks the cultural practices through which sexual figures—particularly the sex worker and the lesbian—are produced in the public imagination. Her analysis includes representations of the prostitute figure in popular media, trajectories of queerness in Malayalam films, public discourse on lesbian sexuality, the autobiographical project of sex worker and activist Nalini Jameela, and the memorialization of murdered transgender activist Sweet Maria, showing how various marginalized figures stage their own fractured journeys of resistance in the post-1990s context of globalization.\n\nBy bringing a substantial body of Malayalam-language literature and media texts on gender, sexuality, and social justice into conversation with current debates around sexuality studies and transnational feminism in Asian and Anglo-American academia, Mokkil reorients the debates on sexuality in India by considering the fraught trajectories of identity and rights."

The play is authored by Sadanam Harikumar, a Kathakali playwright and actor, whose contemporary retelling of Hindu myths and epics afford substantial agency to the female characters, compelling radical reimagining of Kathakali’s gender norms, and a reconsideration of the significance of female characters, both on the stage and in the text. \n\nAsti unsettles the conventional norms of womanhood that have defined and structured the ‘Kathakali woman’ over the last five centuries. Although several new Kathakali plays have been created in recent decades, they seldom include strong female roles, so Harikumar’s plays, and his female characters in particular, deserve a historic place in the Kathakali tradition, whose slowly changing gender norms are here analyzed for the first time."

    "abstract": "The missionaries of the Church Missionary Society and London Missionary Society came into close contact with the slave castes of Kerala in the early nineteenth century. This interaction led to the creation of a rich and textured archive on the slave castes, such as the Pulayas and Parayas, among others. In the missionary writings the emotional world of the slave castes appeared for the first time in print in history. In this chapter, an attempt is made to understand the emotional world of the slave castes as represented in missionary writings. It is interesting to look into how the idea of community was articulated among the slaves. The idea of community that was impossible in the traditional slave society was articulated through the forms of worship that the missionaries introduced in the fledgling congregations. We observe that such developments in various parts of Kerala are relevant in understanding the everyday life of the slave castes. The oral tradition of the slave castes refers to emotional aspects of life – pain, separation, longing, love – in a substantial manner in the context of oppression by landlords and caste elites."

Reading development largely depends on the typological and orthographical features of a language. Hence, research investigating the impact of different writing systems on reading processes and acquisition is needed to inform reading models and teaching practices across language/learning contexts. \n\nMalayalam is a prominent Indic language, but has hardly been studied in reading research. Therefore, to stimulate such research, the present chapter explains the orthographical features of Malayalam, considering these in terms of cross-linguistic factors that are important for reading acquisition. \n\nThe chapter then presents a review of the relevant studies in reading, focusing on akshara orthographies and those recognising metalinguistic awareness as an aspect of successful reading acquisition, particularly in multilingual contexts. The chapter ends by arguing that phoneme-based instructional strategies should be usefully applied to Malayalam, despite its akshara characteristics."

It follows analytical methods to understand how geographical spaces act as sites that maintain caste in modern times. \n\nThis is all the more significant for the fact that space has been a significant vector through which the caste structure was maintained historically. This is done by analysing the life narratives of Saleena Prakkanam and C. K. Janu, who led some of the important struggles for land in postcolonial Kerala. \n\nAt a conceptual level, the chapter attempts to explore the mutually constitutive nature of spatiality and subjectivity. Specifically, the constitution of Dalit and Adivasi women’s subjectivity in negotiation with the spaces they inhabit/interact with is the focus of analysis. \n\nThis understanding unsettles the existing ideas about the relationship between space and womanhood. In other words, the progressive mode of understanding women’s subjectivity in terms of the private/public dyad becomes insufficient to understand the specificities through which Dalit/Adivasi women’s subjectivity gets constituted in diverse spatialities."

    "abstract": "The ‘conversion’ of slave castes was a complex phenomenon, and there are a number of theories woven together by various historiographical schools regarding their conversion in Kerala. While social and economic aspects predominate in the study of religious conversion among the lower castes in South India, most ignore the presence of religious desires among slave caste Christians and their ‘inner transformation’ after encountering protestant Christian missionaries. \n\nWhile caste was also present in the church, experiences of suffering and discrimination that Dalits faced in their everyday lives forced them to transcend their hardships through prayers, songs, stories, etc. These songs were, hence, not mere expressions, but embedded within Dalit resistance and struggle against and within hegemonic power relations. \n\nAlthough a substantial amount has already been written about the social aspects of religious conversion among Dalits in Kerala, a significant number of Dalit Christian songs have not been adequately analyzed. Though Christian songs were largely used to reach out to larger audiences during the colonial period, these also contained certain specific messages and ideas. \n\nThe songs informing singers and listeners about the abolition of agrestic slavery in Travancore (1855) were important in this context. However, over time, compositions depicting the discrimination of Dalit Christians, and the caste-based contempt they physically faced, also increased, reflecting the hope and anguish of Dalit Christians. In effect, Dalit Christian songs exemplify a variety of ‘linguistic’ modernity for Dalits in Kerala and the Malayalam in these poems and song were perceived as being uncontaminated by the caste. \n\nFinally, Christian songs are important for Dalit history and their search for rights and citizenship in a caste ridden society. The present paper offers an analysis of the Dalit songs in Malayalam with a view to construct new knowledge that will push forward the frontiers of historical scholarship."

The codification approach of Kerala draws particular attention—not only with its pretext of historical pertinence of local healing systems in the public health services, but also the sheer difference in the objective and practice of documentation by different institutional types and domination of a number of new stakeholders. \n\nEven though it raises complex questions regarding the legitimacy and validation of knowledge, informed sharing, and the perceived outcome, the case of Kerala altogether forms a variant discourse where the possibilities of local democratic institutions and academia are utilized in both the coordination and co-management of resources and the protection of knowledge. This also produces new examples in sharing commercial benefits. \n\nWe present this discourse through three dominant cases of documentation within the state. The idea of ‘knowledge commons’ suggested by the recent policy discussions in Kerala claims to coordinate these multiple processes of revitalization and offers an alternative to the casualties of the existing protection mechanisms."

    "abstract": "The history of community is best understood as an archive of collective memory. The history of Christianity in Kerala, where Christians belonging to different castes/sects constitute around twenty percent of the total population, has unfolded in an ensemble of multiple narratives about community. \n\nNonetheless, caste and sectarianism have been the vantage points for the historiographical analysis of the Christian community in Kerala. As a result, experiences of a 'minor' community, with its heterogeneous genealogies, has often been translated into the homogeneous language of colonial and nationalistic discourses of the Hindu majoritarian 'secular' nation-state. There has been little space for narratives that explicate community as a subjective experience, based on ontology and belief. \n\nThis study, hence, explores textual universes of Christianity in Kerala as an experiential category to engage with communities in transition. In doing so, the analysis problematises the existing archive as that which identifies a faith community as a historically available category, and re-reads and extends this archive to enable new interpretations of Christian subjectivity in the region. We re-read historical narratives in an attempt to destabilize the ways in which the history of communities is perceived as a chronologically evolved structure of events. \n\nThe paper proceeds by critically analyzing various contemporary Malayalam texts that offer new narratives of Christianity, and which foreground heterogeneous genealogies of a community-in-the-becoming. These narratives of Christianity are identifiably at loggerheads with both the canonical and historical understanding of Christianity in Kerala. The community’s history is unfolded in these texts as an experiential category with political implications for the imagination of Christianity in the region, and in doing so, we offer an analytical frame to identify community within its discursive formations. \n\nThe paper argues that Christianity in Kerala manifests an ‘Eastern’ imagination that enables us to explore possibilities beyond discourses generated by ‘Western’ Christianity and the Christian ‘West’."

    "abstract": "Scholars have hitherto examined the 20th-century as a period strongly influenced by the cultural and aesthetic impact of cinema. This cultural influence has spread across the globe, through colonial empires and then through globalisation. \n\nIn Kerala, the influence of this cinematic image-regime is evident in the postmodern fiction that achieves a niche readership in the late 1990s. \nPostmodern culture in Kerala receives some popular interest in the 1990s, through the pervasiveness of technological culture and ubiquitous access to television and cinema. \nThrough a theoretical and textual engagement with the fiction of Maythil Radhakrishnan, this paper seeks to show that in Kerala, this new mode of writing is made possible and intelligible under the image-regime of cinema.\n\nMaythil’s oeuvre expresses its postmodern aesthetics through a new process of articulating thought, space, time and affect – a new kind of articulation made possible in the age of cinema."

    "abstract": "This book examines the operational dynamics of patriarchy that is deeply woven into the Indian cultural fabric and its persistence in spite of women advancing in Human Development Indices. In studying the situation of women of the Catholic Syrian Christian community of Kerala, South India, as a case of analysis, Kochurani Abraham identifies caste consciousness and religious prescriptions of this community as the main factors that intersect with gendered identity construction and succeed in keeping women within its patriarchal confines. While women do engage in negotiating patriarchy through what can be termed simulative, tactical, and ‘agensic’ bargains, this remains a ‘politics of survival’ as it does not challenge the established gender order.  In this context, making a shift from ‘politics of survival’ to a ‘politics of subversion’ is imperative for challenging persisting patriarchies."

The Big Six and their immediate followers wrote about the common man, peasants, pavement-dwellers, fishermen, rickshaw-pullers, underpaid school teachers — their lives, aspirations, and vulnerabilities. \n\nBy treating Kaaroor’s stories as case studies, the book takes a sociological approach to understanding the representation of a wide array of themes: romantic overtones, erotic pursuits, marital episodes, issues of family, lives of children, behavioural patterns, shades of greed, the idea of spirituality, and politics in Malayalam literature."

    "abstract": "Momentarily or permanently displaced from the State of origin owing to poverty and developmental inequities, the Inter-State Migrant (ISM) workers find themselves encountering different forms of rights violations in both work and public places in the host state, which contributes to the sense of alienation. Further, the marginalisation process is accentuated by the highly disorganised and volatile nature of the ISM workers in Kerala owing to the heterogeneous character arising from diverse regional, religious, caste and gender backgrounds, varied work settings and persistent work-related seasonality and mobility. Caught between the demands of the highly formalised state welfare system and the fluidity of the informal work setting, the ISM workers find themselves excluded and powerless to negotiate for rights and assert their citizenship. Though recently there have been attempts for ensuring inclusive spaces for the in-migrants through various legislative and policy measures, the strategic failure in effective implementation is obvious and a matter of grave concern. The paper highlights the urgency for proactive measures to be taken by the state and civil society groups in both the states for ensuring the citizenship rights of the ISM workers. The content for the paper is drawn through the review of <i>Economic Review</i> from 2009 to 2016, brought out by Kerala State Planning Board, newspaper reports, policies and legislation pertaining to migrant labourers in Kerala and selected studies conducted on the subject by academic institutions, non-governmental agencies and individual researchers."

As a docu-fiction, the film uses actual footage from the political struggles and agitations and restages certain events with the actual participants involved to document and critique the actions, dreams, and failures of the Left movement of the preceding decades in Kerala. \n\nThe second is the performance titled <i>Atlas of Communism</i>, directed by the Argentinean director Lola Arias, that premiered in Maxim Gorki theatre in 2016. Using testimonial format, the performance brings together people who stage their first-person narratives to critically look back at the failure of GDR and the contemporary unified Germany. \n\nBy paying attention to the ways in which rhythms and scales redefine experiences and the everyday life in these works, the essay explores how excavating and critiquing the past as failure becomes a worksite of the Left precisely because this excavation also offers an affirmation as a determinate matter in a given situation."

    "abstract": "The state of Kerala has been a favourite soil for internal migrants in India in the recent years. The number of migrants multiplies every year owing to the high demand for labourers in unorganized sectors and high wages in Kerala. The state government, considering the significance of the migrants in the state economy and labour force, has introduced a slew of schemes over the years to provide social security to them. Aawaz is a new health insurance scheme, first of its kind in India that looks forward to bring all migrants under its cover. However, Aawaz enrolment is problematic and full of impediments. Despite the best efforts taken by the officials, the enrolment is still incomplete due to a variety of reasons. This paper takes a look at the factors that come in the way of implementation of the Aawaz in full swing and how the government personnel manage to overcome the challenges."

Alankita Srivastava, 2017), a phone-sex scandal in Kerala, and the use of voiceover dubbing in the soft-porn industry as case studies, I argue that while these objects arguably exist as different ‘genres’ and operate at varying levels of ‘offensiveness’, they offer us ways of locating how sound becomes a site and object of contestation in the public sphere."

It explores the influence of socio-demographic and migration-specific characteristics of the migrant and the migrant-sending (remittance receiving) households on the amount of remittance transfers. Using data from the 2011 Kerala Migration Survey, we employed Heckman selection correction model and Tobit model for the analysis. The results suggest that the migrant’s individual characters have a strong influence in the remittance-sending behaviour while the characteristics of the remittance-receiving household have a weaker influence. The migration-specific characteristics—the duration of migration, destination country and presence of dependents abroad—significantly affect the amount of remittance sent."

    "abstract": "In India, the literature on migration studies significantly captured the phenomena of emigration from Kerala to the Gulf countries. In Kerala, largest chunk of emigrant population is constituted by Muslims, but the existing literature put less focus on Muslims migratory pattern. With this outline, this chapter examines the forced nature of migratory pattern among the Muslims from Malappuram district, Kerala, to the Gulf countries. The findings from the fieldwork conducted among the Muslims shows that the factors that motivated the Muslim youth in Malappuram go beyond the reasons mentioned in the existing literature on migration from Kerala. The evidences from the village suggest that the socioeconomic situation that existed during 1960s, 1970s and 1980s and also the prevalence of poverty and unemployment level among the Kerala Muslims triggered them to emigrate to the Gulf countries, mainly to Saudi Arabia. Poverty, joblessness, availability of Umrah and free visa to Saudi Arabia, prevailing dowry system and the practice of luxurious marriage culture existed in the village. Coupled with one or more factors mentioned above, the dream and aspiration to work in the Gulf to enhance their standard of living motived them to emigrate. These suggest the forced nature of emigration from Malappuram to Gulf region."

    "abstract": "Migration is a gendered experience. Who moves and who does not, the resources that can be allocated for an individual’s movement, the networks that can be tapped to facilitate mobility, the sectors of the economy where there are possibilities of employment, the conditions of work, family support required and the usage of remittances and so on are issues that impact men and women differently. Moreover, the impact of migration on personal relationships is said to be more significant for women migrants than men. While structuralist, neoliberal or network theorists explain migration in a gender-neutral manner, feminist theorists draw out the contexts and challenges specific to women’s migration. Moreover, they give equal importance to the question of what happens after migration. They prefer to study the migration through personal narratives that help explain the nuances of experiences. This chapter draws upon some extant anthropological studies on the migration experience of women from Kerala who work as nurses and domestic workers in the Middle East and critically analyses them through the feminist lens. The section Feminist Lens of Migration Research presents the essence of the feminist framework. Using this analytical frame, the section Deconstructing the Narratives of Migrant Nurses revisits the narratives of nurse migration. In a similar manner, the section Deconstructing the Narratives of Migrant Domestic Workers explores the narratives of domestic worker migration. Finally, the section Comparing the Two Migration Streams compares the experiences of the two migration streams."

    "abstract": "India to Gulf emigration is not a new phenomenon. Its history dates back to several centuries ago. The massive flow of emigration from India significantly started from the mid-1970s. During 1973–1974, the oil companies were mushrooming in West Asia. Thousands of Indians came to the Gulf countries, especially those who were mostly from Kerala. In India, Kerala has significant number of emigrants who end up in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries every year. According to Centre for Development Studies (CDS) migration survey series from 1998 to 2014, international migration from Kerala accounted for 13.6 lakhs people in 1998, which increased to 24 lakhs in 2014. Among the gulf emigration registered, about 93.9 per cent of the total emigration was recorded in 1998, which declined to 86.3 per cent in 2014. Based on this background, the study attempts to analyse the trend of Keralite emigrants to the Gulf countries and the role of their remittances on Kerala’s economy. In addition, the study also analyses socio-demographic conditions of emigrants from Kerala to the Gulf countries. The study used the data obtained from Kerala migration survey series from 1998 to 2014 undertaken by the Centre for Development Studies, Thiruvananthapuram. The study uses ratio method to estimate the total number of migrants in Kerala during this survey period (2014). In this survey, to estimate the total emigrants from Kerala, two approaches of ratio method have been employed. The first method is referred to as household method in which the migrant ratio in the sampled locality is used with the same locality Households (HHs) number. The second method is referred to as population method; in this, migrant ratio in a locality is used with the same locality population. This study found that gulf emigrants and their remittances significantly contributed to the state economy and at the same time improved educational profile of the emigrants. Based on these results, it can safely be assumed that similar trends in the socioeconomic conditions of the emigrants from Kerala would be seen wherever they had migrated."

    "abstract": "This article explores historical shifts in the ways the Muslim barbers of South Asia are viewed and the intertwined ways they are conceptualised. Tracing various concepts, such as caste identity, and their multiple links to contempt, labour and Islamic ethical discourses and practices, this article demonstrates shifting meanings of these concepts and ways in which the Muslim barbers of Malabar (in southwest India) negotiate religious and social histories as well as status in everyday life. The aim was to link legal and social realms by considering how bodily comportment of barbers and pious Muslims intersect and diverge. Relying on ethnographic fieldwork among Muslim barbers of Malabar and their oral histories, it becomes apparent that status is negotiated in a fluid community where professional contempt, multiple attitudes about modernity and piety crosscut one another to inform local perceptions of themselves or others. This paper seeks to avoid the presentation of a teleology of past to present, binaries distinguishing professionals from quacks, and the pious from the scorned. The argument instead is that opposition between caste/caste-like practices and Islamic ethics is more complex than an essentialised dichotomy would convey."

    "abstract": "This article focuses on two Malayalam films such as Ore Kadal (The Sea Within, 2007) and Artist (2013) directed by Shyamaprasad. \nThe article argues that these films break the shackles of middle-class moralities and heteronormative practices, and challenge ‘traditional’ Indian values of arranged marriages and hierarchical gender relations. \nThrough a narrative analysis of the two films, the article examines the conception of an alternative image of women, the transformation from silent endurance to sexual equality and the embrace of individualism and liberalism. \n\nIn both these films, what is at stake is the notion of heteronormative families, where women go against the grain of the ways in which the idea of family is articulated in Indian society. \nShyamaprasad’s films offer a poignant critique of normative gender ideologies and idealised notions of domesticity."

As an ongoing dynamic social process, migration has led to numerous jaati anxieties among Syrian Christians. \n\nThe fear of trailing endogamous networks, increasing anonymity, lack of social ‘distinctions’, especially in migration destinations, are forms of anxieties expressed in family histories. These concerns are addressed through a variety of textual strategies often aimed at younger members of the family."

    "abstract": "The Adivasis’ ownership rights over resources are intertwined with the history of managing, conserving, and governing the Indian forest by the colonial and postcolonial State. This history has been divided into three different phases in this paper. \n\nIn the first phase, the forestry was merely understood in terms of managing the forest and enforcement of the colonial rules and regulations. This model was primarily based on the commercial and economic significance of the forest. In the second phase, there was a shift from management to conservation of the forest. In both these stages, rights of the Adivasis over resources were curtailed. In the third phase, forestry was turned to forest governance and the Adivasi rights started getting recognised to a greater degree compared to the past. \n\nIn this historical context, this paper explores the impact of State-led forest management in India on the cultural, social, and economic life of the local community through an empirical analysis of the Kadar Adivasi community in Kerala, India. Kadar community is one of the severely marginalised groups due to the State’s various development and conservation programmes. \n\nThis paper unravels the various ways in which postcolonial laws in India have consistently failed to offer any legal protection, and eventually marginalised, the locality-specific knowledge on conservation developed by the indigenous people through their cultural institutions, which have been informed by their lived experience in the forest areas over a long period of time. The paper concludes by delineating the complex interface between conservation practices of the Kadar Adivasis and State-initiated policies and programmes for conserving the forest and its resources."

One of them lived in Amsterdam in the Dutch Republic and the other lived in Cochin, which was controlled by the United East India Company (VOC). \n\nIn these different social and institutional contexts, both women were subject to ‘gatekeeping’ by authorities who intervened to restrict the extent of their mobility. \n\nAlthough considerable research has been done on how marriage influenced early modern women’s opportunities and life in general, less attention has been paid to the impact of marriage on a woman’s mobility, especially when marital desertion was the motivation behind that mobility. \n\nThe literature on marital desertion generally focuses on husbands who deserted their wives; however, in the two cases discussed here, we find not only that women’s mobility was affected by marriage, but also that women’s mobility could be seen as a threat to the institution of marriage."

    "abstract": "The migration process raises a set of migration-related risks and vulnerabilities, yet recognising these as collective problems is paramount to formulating public policy responses. As one of the first subnational states globally, the South Indian state Kerala has institutionalised various social protection policies toward emigrants and returned migrants under the department of Non-Resident Keralites’ Affairs (NORKA) and its implementation agency NORKA ROOTS. \n\nTaking the case of Kerala, this article investigates why subnational states recognise their international emigrants and return migrants as deserving of social protection provisions. Subnational states matter as they are sites of diaspora identification, and it is where migration’s consequences, such as emigrants’ philanthropic development projects and the reintegration of returned migrants, unfold. At the same time, they have less legislative and infrastructural power than federal states in engaging with emigrants and destination countries. \n\nBy drawing on original data, the article argues that (returned) emigrants’ access to social protection schemes is built on understandings of deservingness based on a combination of protection rationales and economic rationales, rooted in Kerala’s specific developmental and identity discourse. The study demonstrates that despite subnational states having limited institutional capabilities compared with federal states, they are essential stakeholders in articulating transnational social protection policies."

Debt-financed emigrants spend high costs on visas, air tickets, and passports as majority of them are recruited through agents than non-debt-financed emigrants. Debt migration may not be a profitable or sustainable endeavour, as non-debt migrants’ annual savings and monthly expenditures are higher than debt migrants. The debt-to-income ratio (DTI) also shows that the financial health of the debt-financed migrant household is in more severe condition than the non-debt."

The study used input variables such as rainfall, land use/land cover (LU/LC) and soil data to estimate the runoff depth from these catchments during the floods in 2018 and 2019 using the SCS-CN model. Here, the hydrological response of these catchments is examined by different scenarios of rainfall and LU/LC change. \n\nIt is found that the forested catchment generates more runoff compared to the deforested catchment under identical rainfall conditions. However, the study shows that, the runoff depth in the deforested catchment is expected to reduce if certain portion of plantations and barren land converts into the forest cover. The ability of runoff retention of the forested catchment is expected to lose if the forest-covered land is utilized for the plantation activities."

It argues that the connectivities and unintentional designs that emerge bespeak the Anthropocene in its regional and political peculiarities. The river has never been a conduit of water alone. The narrative builds broadly on ecological relations entrenched in history, most visibly as hydrological regimes. Such regimes are significant because of the riparian densities that articulate the geo-morphology. \n\nThe different entanglements in ecology, as well as the successive productions of natures, gain significance as ‘recognitions’ during rupture events like the large floods. In contemporary contexts, the versatile flows of capital dissolve markers and boundaries and reconfigure regions in terms of capital. Vikasanam or new urban reforms, apart from political policies, are also ecological designs that normalise exceptions, otherwise reserved for special economic zones. \n\nThe frictions with new materiality, post dam floods and hydrological controls, during developmental and neoliberal post developmental phases, become moments of recognition, making and unmaking sense of place."

    "abstract": "The construction industry plays a vital role in the economic development of any country. Concurrently, the sector also generates enormous quantities of construction and demolition waste (CDW) that damages the ecology causing environmental pollution and deteriorating human health. \n\nRecently, various governments and other organizations realized the importance of implementing construction waste management (CWM) practices to attain sustainability in construction. The current decade can be called a pathway for achieving the 2030 agenda for sustainable development goals in which CWM plays an inevitable role. However, accurately quantifying construction waste is necessary to successfully implement any CDW management plan. \n\nA detailed literature review for the current research revealed that limited information on the magnitude of construction waste is available in India. Therefore, the current paper proposes a practically viable model to estimate the waste generation index (construction waste generated per total floor area) of high-rise residential buildings in India. \n\nThe waste quantification is being done based on the project documents and expert interviews. The methodology is later validated through a high-rise building with G + 18 stories located in Kerala, India. The study indicated that a high-rise concrete framed structure generates 122.3 kg m−2 of waste during construction. It was also noted that, concrete, aggregates and blocks constitute 92% of the total waste generated in the project. The developed model can also be used as a cornerstone for establishing a construction waste database at the regional level."

    "abstract": "The article broadly discusses significant debates around the Kerala Model of Development. The question of land redistribution and the significance of land as a vital resource ensuring upward mobility has been widely discussed since the land reform. The land reform of Kerala was reduced merely to a tenancy reform in which the dalits were offered not agricultural land but only homestead land for their mere survival. Landless people, often under the banner of dalit and adivasi organizations, conducted several important land struggles, effectively rejecting the solution of responsibilised welfare proffered by Panchayati Raj institutions. In this debate, the question of the inability of Kerala’s celebrated land reforms to redistribute hugely—concentrated plantation land came into prominence. \n\nSome of the most spectacular land struggles, such as those at Chengara and Aralam involved direct action by squatters to occupy plantation land. There were either struggle for access to land or struggle against forced dispossession. These struggles are mostly outside the formal sphere of politics and often regarded with hostility by entrenched political forces, at least in the initial phases. \n\nThe article looks at the Chengara land struggle in which the squatter poor (landless) and the plantation workers were pitted against each other when the landless started illegally and forcefully settling in the plantation land of Harrisons Malayalam. The marginalisation and exploitation faced by the two groups, their sharing and differences in various ways are analysed in this article. The work also questions certain characterisations of plantation workers, which portrayed them as enjoying considerable well-being. The broad framework of compromises—class compromise and caste compromise—is applied in analysing the opposition of the two groups to each other."

It also looks at the role of digital technology and social media in the mobilization, organization, and sustenance of the movement."

    "abstract": "This article revisits 50 years of the development trajectory of India’s Kerala state, well known for its human development attainments. To put the discussion in perspective we use a conceptual framework integrating growth, inequality and well-being. Long accustomed to a low per capita income and caste–class iniquities of the worst order, Kerala acquired great human development and social justice largely through a process of public action involving the state and society. The article argues how the liberalization reforms of the 1990s and beyond, while ushering in an era of unprecedented growth shows signs of widening inequalities and marginalization of the poor, in particular the historically deprived communities. The widely known land reforms virtually bypassed the poor and the state now has a highly skewed land distribution. The service-led growth of Kerala with a dual structure of earnings has a built-in bias towards inequality. The state budget has not been an instrument of equity and the policy choices of the state and the union need strategic reorientation."

    "abstract": "This article demonstrates how highly-politicised assessments of agrarian distress have affected professional and public perceptions of the causes of suicide, specifically in the region of Wayanad, north-eastern Kerala. Because of a bifurcation between purely sociological and purely psychological analyses of suicide, current mental health policy downplays socio-economic factors and actively promotes specifically psychiatric analyses of victims and their families. Yet, for the sake of political representation in the public sphere, sociological analyses facilitate the construction of discursive categories relating to farmer distress.\nThe article shows how this has meant that the struggles of certain underprivileged groups, specifically the indigenous Paniya community, are thereby rendered invisible. Moving beyond the existing dualistic approaches, field-based research findings also demonstrate the potential to see suicide as a form of communication that provides important counter-narratives to the dominant discourse about suicides in South Asia."

    "abstract": "Technical education contributes a major share to the overall education system and plays a vital role in the social and economic development of our nation. Since independence, the technical education system in our country has grown into a fairly large-sized system, offering opportunities for education and training in a wide variety of trades and disciplines at the certificate, diploma, degree, postgraduate degree and doctoral levels in institutions located throughout the country. India is renowned for producing graduates of the highest calibre, but only very few compared with its population receive high-quality technical education. India has over the years significantly bolstered the quality and availability of technical education, doubling the employment rate of graduates who are now better suited to the needs of the Indian industry. The challenges posed by this rapidly growing technical education system in our country are extremely complex in nature, with the employability of fresh engineering graduates getting multiplied to be a major hurdle. The issues and challenges faced by the technical education sector and its future prospects are discussed in this article taking the scenario prevailing in the state of Kerala as an example. A detailed picture is depicted in this article by portraying the availability of seats and institutes in technical education in Kerala. Issues faced and possible solutions are also highlighted."

In doing this, the discussion underlines the tremendous social and cultural influence of neighbours and the neighbourhood and argues that neighbourhoods need to be seen as a social formation as important as caste, class, ethnicity or religion. This is particularly important given that a strong focus on identities in recent decades has tended to eclipse social formations such as the neighbourhood. This ethnographic discussion is based on fieldwork carried out in neighbourhoods in two towns in India, Thalassery in Kerala, South India and Bikaner in Rajasthan, North India."

With an increasing sense of disappointment about the decline of cosmopolitanism in such metropolitan cities, there is a need to look at what other locales can offer as alternative models of cosmopolitanism. This article addresses Kochi as a locale that is nuanced with precolonial practices of cosmopolitanism. This move towards provincialising cosmopolitanism ? in the sense of moving away from metropolitan locales to highlight deeper, more historical and local ways of being cosmopolitan ? is informed by the growing emphasis on the need to explore subaltern or vernacular cosmopolitanism."

In order to control these diseases, the prevalence of modifiable risk factors such as low physical activity need to be studied. For this a cross-sectional study was conducted to assess the level of physical activity among 240 residents aged between 15 and 65 years in Kulappuram, a village in north Kerala. Low level of physical activity was seen in 65.8% of the study participants. The average duration of moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity per day in different domains such as work, travel, and recreation were 40.5, 10.1, and 12.7 minutes, respectively. The average duration of sedentary activities was 284.3 minutes per day. The level of physical activity was more among those engaged in unskilled work (adjusted odds ratio = 4.32; confidence interval = 1.38-13.51) and unmarried persons (adjusted odds ratio = 3.65; confidence interval = 1.25-10.65). No statistically significant difference in physical activity level was seen in different age, education, religious, and economic categories. The study concludes that the physical activity level was low in the study population."

It addresses the following questions: How was civil society used as a platform for this struggle and what was the outcome? Did this campaign affect the political participation of its members? The study is based on interviews and surveys of the villagers in Plachimada and connects to theories on social movements and political participation, as well as to the debate on Indian civil society. The findings presented show the importance of having a local, core group in charge of the campaign, while simultaneously making use of existing support groups at the regional, national, and international levels. It also reveals that after reaching its goal, the campaign has resulted in a general increase of political participation amongst its members."

Its particular focus is on members of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI (M)). For more than four decades, members of the CPI (M) and the Hindu Right have been involved in an intermittent but occasionally intense conflict. Their conflict highlights how modern practices of political mobilisation and competition condition the formation of close-knit antagonistic masculine unities regardless of the ideological affiliations in question; its violent context foregrounds affects and emotions that characterise life in such fraternal communities. While such unities have become central to the enactment of collective agency in many contexts, strong limits mark these communities. Not just those outside a community, but also those within it apprehend these limits. Violent experiences emerge as idealised modes of imagining communion with members of one’s community, as well as forces that individuate them. Biographies and narratives of Left- and Right-wing workers who once sought close integration with their respective communities but now live apart from them, illuminate the already present limits of commonality and unity possible in modern political communities."

    "abstract": "The ‘Public interest’, even if viewed with ambiguity or scepticism, has been one of the primary means by which various professional roles of planners have been justified. Many objections to the concept have been advanced by writers in planning academia. Notwithstanding these, ‘public interest’ continues to be mobilised, to justify, defend or argue for planning interventions and reforms. This has led to arguments that planning will have to adopt and recognise some form of public interest in practice to legitimise itself. This paper explores current debates around public interest and social justice and advances a vision of the public interest informed by complexity theory. The empirical context of the paper is the poverty alleviation programme, the Kudumbashree project in Kerala, India."

    "abstract": "This article evaluates the salience of classical theory in explaining societal transformation in the digital era. Functionalism, Marxism, and Weberian traditions are first summarized and then applied to a better understanding of how new information and communication technologies (ICTs) are shaping cultural spaces outside the advanced nations of the north. The nation of Ghana and the Indian state of Kerala are ideal social settings to assess the authority of these perspectives. The historical similarities of these two less developed world regions are persuasive, yet their present differences are telling. Although a Weberian perspective may best explain Ghana’s cultural proclivity for hierarchical domination, Marxist and functionalist theories may best explain how it will experience the diffusion of new ICTs within a globally dependent setting. Ghana’s entrenched local and global interests, rationalized along material lines, could be displaced temporarily by new ICTs; but then Ghanaian society may reequilibrate through a reestablishment of historical patterns of exploitation. On the other hand, functionalist and Weberian perspectives best frame the advantages that Kerala is experiencing in the information age. Its proximity to indigenous technological and media centers, its political safety net in greater India, its aging, yet dense population and its reformist tradition of equality and stability all support the wide diffusion of new ICTs for development. This suggests that Kerala could better accrue the predicted collective benefits of these new technologies compared with Ghana."

    "abstract": "In the present global business environment, organizations need different approaches for overcoming the current demands and future challenges for which a creative workplace is a prerequisite. To understand workplace creativity in depth, we need to examine the interactions between personal and contextual characteristics as well as interactions among the contextual characteristics in an organization. Although researchers have attempted to understand the interactions between personal and contextual characteristics, enough attention has not been paid to the interactions among the contextual variables of employee creativity. In the present study, an attempt has been made to examine the interacting role of task complexity with work autonomy in contribution towards workplace creativity. The study has been carried out upon 304 information technology (IT) professionals working in different IT companies located in the Kochi and Trivandrum region of the state of Kerala. Findings reveal that the three dimensions of work autonomy, namely, work method autonomy, work schedule autonomy and work criteria autonomy have a direct positive contribution towards workplace creativity. Direct positive contribution towards workplace creativity is also exhibited by task complexity. As far as the moderating effect is concerned, task complexity is found to moderate significantly the relationships of work criteria as well as work schedule dimension of work autonomy with workplace creativity."

Nurses then resort to sensemaking to tide over the pandemic-affected work circumstances by balancing contextual demands and personal resources. \n\nBy integrating PCB experienced by these nurses via a W–HR model framework, we address calls by researchers to understand how psychological contracts change over time."

The attack rate was 41.2% among those who consumed chicken biriyani compared to 6.9% among those who consumed vegetarian meals. The risk difference (95% CI) was 34.34 % (22.8-45.6), and the risk ratio (95% CI) was 6 (1.6-23) for chicken biriyani compared to vegetarian meals. The attributable fraction (95% CI) among those who ate chicken biriyani was 83.3% (35.6-95.6), and the population attributable fraction was 81.2%. We recommend strengthening of laboratory capacity for detecting foodborne pathogens and active surveillance of all food handlers and food preparation areas with the coordination of food safety, health and local self government departments."

    "abstract": "The formation of regions is as complex a process as the formation of countries or nations. Geography has much to do with it in some cases, languages in others. But political events, commercial networks and tribal or caste dominance can also play their part. History, actual or imagined, may be invoked to create regional consciousness. This article examines how owing to complex factors Kerala came to be identified as a definite region by the sixteenth century, so identified not only by its mainstream tradition but also by people external to it."

    "abstract": "Higher education institutions (HEIs) are expected to be established in conjunction with the specificities of the regions to which they are supposed to belong. But over the years, the regional necessities based on its resourcefulness and demographic potential are seldom accounted for in their justifiable dissemination across the state. This article analyze (a) whether our HEIs are established by satisfying the needs of its geographical area and (b) whether the programmes offered by them have any mutual benefits to the regional populace and academic community. Various resource diversities are attached with every institution, in the context of contesting components of science and other academic disciplines. This study proposes a synergic model to facilitate the allocation of academic programmes and dissemination of institutions with 10 broad synergic bands, each incorporating various resource potentials available with every geographical niche. A total of 54 government arts and science colleges of the state have been geocoded and tagged with these bands, to find the institutional synergies with their surrounding resources. Although colleges capture synergy points ranging from two to nine, but only a few of the institutions are enriched with higher numbers of bands. The more synergy points the institution captures, the more will be its academic potential in terms of feasibility of programmes in consideration of sustainable development of the locality in which they are situated. This model is therefore an instrument for every institution and to self-evaluate its performance for the societal prosperity of their immediate neighbourhood."

    "abstract": "The Government of India made a series of policy changes regarding elementary school education in the country in the period 2002–2012. In 2009 the Government made free (and compulsory) education a fundamental right of every child in India between the ages of six and fourteen. The Government also set out the infrastructure provisions that schools were mandated to implement. In doing so, it adopted a rights-based approach to elementary school education. This paper reports on a study of the effectiveness of this approach. It is argued that merely declaring a public service as a citizens’ right does not entail either optimal access or optimal implementation. Rather, the paper argues that claiming of rights and implementation requires an enabling environment and it is concluded that societal power bias and social accountability are important factors in creating such an environment. The examples of Kerala and Bihar, respectively the best and worst performing states in India with regard to implementation of the right to education, were used to examine these states’ different levels of performance regarding the mandates defined by the Right to Education legislation enacted in 2009."

Participants took part in interviews where they were encouraged to talk about their experiences of mental ill health, attitudes towards these problems, barriers encountered and sources of support.\n\nResults: Experiences akin to the experience of stigma in Europe and the United States were elicited but there were important local dimensions specific to the Indian context. The difficulties faced by people with diagnoses of mental disorders in finding marriage partners was seen as an important problem, leading to marriage proposals being refused in some cases, and secrecy on the part of those with mental health problems. Rather than the 'self-stigma' identified in the US, participants were more likely to see this as a collective problem in that it could reflect badly on the family group as a whole rather than just the sufferer.\n\nConclusions: In the Indian context, the idioms of stigma emphasised impairments in marriage eligibility and the implications for the family group rather than just the self."

Family size more than 4 (odds ratio [OR] = 2.34; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.13-4.82), family member with chronic disease (OR = 2.05; 95% CI = 1.18-3.57), high socioeconomic status (OR = 2.95; 95% CI = 1.74-5.03), and an employed household head (OR = 2.69; 95% CI = 1.44-5.02) were significantly associated with insured households. Insured households had higher inpatient service utilization (OR = 1.57; 95% CI = 1.05-2.34). Only 40% of inpatient service utilization among the insured was covered by insurance. The mean OOP expenses for inpatient services among insured (INR 448.95) was higher than among uninsured households (INR 159.93); P = .003. These findings show that urgent attention of the government is required to redesign and closely monitor the scheme."

In the parlance of official accounts and modern histories, these revolts are mere disturbances or controversies and the subaltern rebels in these struggles were always pretenders. Contrary to this, an attempt is made here to document and explicate the becoming of the pretender and to demonstrate that historiography may well be implicated, all too easily, in generating the very precarity of the pretender by opposing any movement towards reform."

    "abstract": "Regardless of the significant social reform, the deep-rooted caste system prevails in the landscape of Kerala. The extreme oppression that the Dalit community faced forced them to seek a new identity with religious conversions. However, the caste considerations straddled the religions and followed the converts. Moreover, the conversion failed to compensate for their material deprivations, and the converted identity denied the rightful privileges of Dalits, which hampered their social mobility. \n\nThis article analyses the social inclusion of a Pulaya (a Dalit community) family converted to Christianity in Kerala. The analysis of the qualitative data collected through relational interviewing revealed the issues with the social inclusion of the converted Christians, despite the high moral code they adopted. Furthermore, the quantitative comparison of welfare programmes and reservations for the Dalit community and the converts gives insight into the trending deconversion in Kerala."

Built in the 1920s, this monument, definitely a work of architectural grandeur, continues to carry its erroneous rendition and confines India?s vast social histories to the colonial moment, with an anglo-centric focus. As the monument symbolises the memory of the colonial regime, it also signifies its oppression as well as its exit from the subcontinent, rather than witnessing anyone coming to India, except King George in 1911, as the monument?s title seems to suggest. A mnemonic device of colonialism, this misleading label needs to be seriously revisited, for it not only romanticises the colonial past but also fails to lead our memories back to certain crucial episodes in earlier social histories, from which the monument and its specific place, Mumbai, are more or less fully absent."

    "abstract": "This article looks at black and white photographs of poor rural Muslims that appear in advertisements and newspaper reports circulated for seeking charity. They appear in the Malayalam newspaper, Chandrika, which is the mouthpiece of the Muslim League, a Muslim-identity-based political party in Kerala, South India. The article attempts to connect politics, charity and gender by looking at photographs in the context of the history of charity in the region of Malabar. Based on oral narratives from Ponnani, a coastal town in Malappuram district, Kerala, and written history, the article analyses how political and social aspirations are historically gendered among Muslims. This is visible in the visual culture which is forged when the material culture of dress and the ways of covering the body inform political and social aspirations of communities, contestations in status and modes of gendering. The photographs are discussed as images that broadly invoke religious meanings, cultural values and memories of the past, especially for those to whom they are addressed—rich male Muslim readers located either in the Gulf or in Kerala. In brief, the article explores how the intersection between politics and charity casts women as objects of reform and sympathy for which women are presented in certain moral ways."

The autobiography, for the author, is not an isolable genre of self-expression but shares its quality of self-articulation with fiction and non-literary writings, which suggests new and shifting styles of self-articulation and inhabitation in a modern world. While providing an outline of the book, I wish to highlight some of its major themes that resonate with the world of modern Tamil letters, a world I am more familiar with."

I begin with a survey of the British colonial construction of Mappila masculinity as, for example, militant religious fanatic, against the historical background of encounters between the two. It follows an examination of the new ways of reproducing these constructs in a changed yet hegemonic narrative public domain of the contemporary where Hindu majoritarian nationalism gathers its momentum. In so doing, this article also scrutinizes the larger mythological and structural elements of the contemporary refiguring. Drawing from these historical and contemporary trajectories, I argue that abjectification of Muslim masculinities is one of the basic ingredients of Islamophobia at work, often in banal forms."

The article maps the historical process by which claims of Brahminical superiority transformed from ritual to knowledge—from claims based on acharam (the daily practices of rituals) into a claim of possession of traditional knowledge. By analysing the upper caste world of Namboothiris, the article explores the tension between emerging order of colonial knowledge and the existing order of acharam. The article shows that until the reform movement in the 1920s, Namboothiris as a community were not part of either traditional or colonial knowledge practices. Even in the reform movement the attempt was not to wholeheartedly enter into the domains of knowledge but to incorporate the elements of acharam into the order of colonial knowledge."

    "abstract": "The article explores ambivalence among middle-class Indian migrants who return to India after their retirement. It discusses intergenerational ambivalence from the dual perspectives of the relation between older migrants and their parents, and that linking the former to their migrant children today. Older migrants’ transnationalism is an important yet under-researched topic. It offers insights into the temporal dimension of ambivalence: how family contradictions accompany and change throughout the life course, and how they orient migrants’ understandings of the past, present, and future. Central to the analysis is the relation between migrant intergenerational ambivalence and the historical development of the Malayali middle class at home and in the diaspora. Moving beyond studies on ambivalence that mainly focus on Euro-American societies, it explores the phenomenon in postcolonial locations. The article discusses the extent to which colonial forms of socio-geographical mobility shape older migrants’ ambivalence across generations, vis-á-vis broader middle-class expectations around educational/professional attainment, reproductive choices, and care provision. It suggests that a temporal perspective on ambivalence is useful to highlight how transnational family ambivalence is shaped not only by present-day uncertainties but also by political and cultural history. It also enhances our understanding of how dispersed families negotiate ambivalence in the long term, and the cumulative effects of these negotiations in the production of novel care arrangements in the present."

The MANOVA test revealed that QWL, sleeping problems, and fatigue were strongly influenced by the department in which they work. The ANOVA test demonstrates that the department and sleeping problems and Fatigue with Marital Status and Age have statistical significance.\n\nSignificance and implications: The studies intended to explore the interactive effects of various factors on fatigue, quality of life, and sleeping difficulties and the association between the fatigue, QWL, and sleeping difficulties all at once, especially during COVID 19 pandemic, are quite rare, even though many investigators worked on research examining the variables impacting fatigue, QWL, and sleeping difficulties among HCWs. Furthermore, this research is crucial in the current COVID 19 scenarios to understand the physical and mental well-being of HCWs to guarantee the safe and effective care of patients and the well-being of the healthcare employees. Fatigue and sleeping problems will likely arise among HCWs; thus, proper precautions should be implemented. According to the study, employees’ QWL was good during the COVID 19 epidemic. Still, continuous fatigue and associated sleeping problems might lead to a loss of QWL, so this study helps the management to opt for various organizational initiatives and appropriate strategies to diminishes the symptoms of fatigue and sleep issues among healthcare workers, allowing HCWs to maintain a high QWL."

In this paper, we build on affective ecology and emotional political ecology literature to demonstrate how people’s subjectivity is transformed through their lived experience of polluted waterscapes, memories of emotional and material engagement with their immediate nature, and affective labour practices to protect their rivers from pollution. \n\nThrough sociological research conducted around two environmental protests in Kerala, we provide insights into local communities’ engagement with the changed riverscape. \n\nOur analysis shows that formation of environmental subjects does not always occur through environmental discourses and governance techniques as the environmentality literature suggests. Rather, there are different pathways to environmental subjectification, which include embodied practices and affective labour. \n\nFor activists involved in Eloor and Kathikudam movements in Kerala, India, their interactions with the river- an immediate nature in both cases- and the memories associated with it act as a central force in the becoming of people who care for the environment. \n\nWe suggest that villagers’ everyday involvement in movement work and struggle to protect rivers from pollution strengthen their individual and collective subjectivities."

    "abstract": "Kerala is a well-recognised ‘model’ of human development in the world. In this article, I look at a crucial aspect of this development, which is often approached in a positivist fashion of statistical aggregation alone: consumption. Instead, there is a need to study the meanings that surround it. \n\nI delineate the many forces, particularly the new material infrastructure, that have driven consumption in the last three decades, especially the last one. With increasing integration into global market forces through migration and investment, and cultural imaginations, I show that there is a tectonic change in consciousness about consumption, marked by fantasies, desires, and, contrarily, feelings of excess and ambivalence. \n\nI argue that the non-market sector has also played an important role in consumption. There is an increasing generalisation of certain ideas about consumption as well as disenchantments across classes. But critically, I contend, there are caste, class, and gender disparities in consumption as well as differences in the meanings attributed to it. Thus, consumption is a socially meaningful, but discrepant, space. \n\nThis article is based on fieldwork conducted in a town in central Kerala, supplemented with quantitative data."

    "abstract": "Mainstream Malayalam cinema of the south Indian state of Kerala has, for the most part, attempted to sidestep the significance of Gulf migration to the region’s development. Part of the reason for this historical neglect has been the prevalence of a particular hegemonic vantage point within the films that has centralised the narratives of the landed elites in Kerala, eliding the various historically marginalised communities within the state. \n\nThis article engages with a recent development within the film industry. It examines how Gulf migration has shaped the affective dimensions and expanding territorial imagination of the New Malayalam Cinema, which has positioned labour migration as one of its central thematic concerns. It is argued that this shift was made possible by the displacement of the universalised territorial imagination of the landed elites in the state that dominated its film industry for most of its history. Subsequently, this article will closely study how director Zakariya places his debut film Sudani from Nigeria (2018) within this new cinematic category, and will demonstrate how he portrays the region of rural Malappuram in north Kerala as a nexus of various migrant experiences, crucially invoking an underlying older order of cosmopolitanism prevalent in the region, fuelled partly by the history of Gulf migration and partly by a tradition and history of migration and transnationalism that predates the formation of the Indian state."

    "abstract": "While the key role that migration plays in the economies of countries like India is widely recognised, subtler affective and cultural circuits are both less easily discerned, and perhaps as a consequence, less explored in scholarly literature. The transnational relation over the past several decades of India to West Asia has produced sophisticated and complex heterogenous forms — both traditional literary novelistic genres, as well as newer forms such as the graphic memoir. \n\nThrough a close and attentive reading of one such memoir, Priya Kuriyan’s “Ebony and Ivory” (2017), this article seeks to articulate the fraught weight of migration. It probes the construction of migrant identities as they unfold over several generations within a single family. The memoir deconstructs the successful economic migrant as in reality bearing the scars of decades of secrecy and shame. Through the use of several refined visual strategies, Kuriyan tells us another tale of the migrant — one that, even as it seeks to carve a special narrative of courage and success in distant lands, must nevertheless also own up to a dismantling of the entrenched narrative of the happy, hardworking immigrant family."

We assessed the prevalence of SOCE, its characteristics, and mental health aspects among LGBT+ individuals in Kerala. This cross-sectional survey used snowball sampling. An online questionnaire collected sociodemographic information and history and characteristics of SOCE. Religiosity and SOCE-associated distress were evaluated using 6-point Likert scales. Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) screened for depressive symptoms; its ninth question assessed death wishes and self-harm thoughts. Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD-7) screened for anxiety symptoms. Participants’ (n = 130) mean age was 26.80 ± 7.12 years. Most common biological sex (63.1%) and gender identity (50.8%) were male, and sexual orientation was gay(42.3%). Prevalence of SOCE was 45.4%. In SOCE group, 39% reported very severe distress. SOCE was most commonly self-prompted (47.5%), performed through psychotherapy (28.8%), and performed by doctors (28.8%). SOCE group had significantly higher religiosity scores (t = 2.61, p = .01). Among cisgender men, 48.48% had SOCE history, against 28.57% among cisgender women (χ2 = 3.19, p = .07). SOCE is highly prevalent among the LGBT+ community in Kerala, with high associated distress. Multi-level approaches are necessary to mitigate this problem."

Musafar Ahammed’s (2014) Kudiyettakkarante Veedu [House of the emigrant], a collection of memoirs; Benyamin’s (2016) Kudiyettam: Pravasathinte Malayalivazhikal [Emigration: Malayali routes of exile], an anthology of essays; and Sam Pynummoodu’s (2016) Kuwait Indian Kudiyetta Charitram: Kuwaitile Indian Pravasavum Malayali Sanidhyavum [A history of Indian emigration into Kuwait: India’s Emigration to and Malayali Presence in Kuwait], a historical work. \n\nThis essay introduces them as microhistorical writings that attempt to document Kerala’s diasporic history — in particular, the history of the Gulf-Keralan diaspora to which the writers belong. At the micro-level, these diasporic histories are distinguished by their multiplicity, particularity, and dialogic association. Furthermore, this essay maintains that the writings acknowledge the agential force of the migrant subject, thereby reinforcing the primacy of the migrant writer and migrant protagonists. In the course of translating subjective experiences into vivid moments of articulation, migrant memory summons a heterogeneous narrative fabric that is characterised by epistemic disjunctures and methodological shifts. Consequently, these texts present an alternative to the canonical literature (as manifested within the ambit of state and academic engagements) on Gulf-Kerala migration, thereby reinventing the dominant historical discourse and recontextualising history in the private realm of embodied narratives."

However, practices adopted by communists in Kerala to maintain their dominance in these geographical regions and how residents of these places relate to these practices have not been sufficiently explored. This article, based on field insights from a panchayat in North Kannur investigates party-society links. It is argued that while material factors help link party and voter, these links are complex and do not conform to clientelism or patronage, as conventionally understood. These links are embedded in a local social context which adds elements of mutuality and non-hierarchical interaction between citizens and party. Ideology also conditions party-society linkages."

It also explores the methodological challenges in broaching the topic of caste with women occupying powerful social locations and how in failing to explore caste in seemingly gender-focused studies, the researcher contributes to an epistemology of ignorance, rendering invisible a crucial power differential."

Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors independently associated with CMD and healthcare utilisation (public or private).\n\nResults: Thirty-four per cent (n=3629) of participants reported having ≥1 CMD, including hypertension (21.6%), diabetes (11.6%), heart disease (5.0%) or chronic kidney disease (CKD) (1.6%). The prevalence of CMD was progressively greater in regions of greater socio-economic position (SEP), ranging from 19.1% to 40.9%. Among those with CMD 41% had sought any medical advice in the last month, with only 19% utilising public health facilities. Among people with CMD, those with health insurance utilised more healthcare (age-gender adjusted odds ratio (AOR) (95% confidence interval (CI)): 1.31 (1.13, 1.51)) as did those who reported accessing private rather than public health services (1.43 (1.23, 1.66)).\n\nDiscussion: The prevalence of CMD is high in these regions of rural India and is positively associated with indices of SEP.

Directly experiencing the dynamic intersection of property, gender and culture as well as legal and socio-cultural change, these women are seen to bargain, often quite consciously, over power and resources, including property, within patterns of matriliny that exist in a wider society influenced by dominant patriarchal norms. The article suggests that this is not as unique to Kerala as is often claimed. It makes a case, therefore, for further research on how South Asian women in the twenty-first century remain torn between matriliny and patriliny, the natal family and the husband?s family, and have to engage in multiple balancing acts to secure their rights."

The study was carried out to explore whether the State?s development initiatives and economic growth trajectory had any space for the Adivasis of Kerala.

    "abstract": "This article proposes a systemic connection between cash-crop gardening, commercialisation and individually-owned landed property in late eighteenth-century Malabar on the southwestern coast of India. The discussion starts with a focus on the English East India Company?s (EIC) early nineteenth-century investigations into land tenure and land tax. It identifies an agreement of opinion between two EIC revenue officers, Thomas Munro (d. 1827) and Francis Whyte Ellis (d. 1819), otherwise known to occupy rival intellectual positions. Both of them agreed on the existence of privately-owned landed assets in the region. This article calls this agreement ?the Malabar consensus? and argues that it was founded on an objective, if not intimate, examination of a set of specific historical conditions. The first section explores the tenurial category janmam or the a??ip??u of the eighteenth century and describes certain procedural innovations in the realm of landed and agrarian assets which mark a generalised transition along the coast of Malabar during the early modern centuries. The second section attempts to explain a set of economic opportunities that the a??ip??u stakeholders, finding themselves in a political and economic transition, found available in the eighteenth century. These innovations and the opportunities they provided were instrumental in creating a substantial class of parvenue landowners, and also an equally significant social class of share-croppers and wage-earners whose emergence characterised the Malabar early modern experience."

The participants were selected using the expert analysis technique of purposeful sampling and data was collected using an interview guide. The interview transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis and are presented in a descriptive format. \n\nDespite the fact that the data in several government agencies are incomplete, it was encouraging to learn that several schemes to assist people with disabilities are being implemented. \n\nLocal governments were responsive to disability even during disasters such as floods and the COVID-19 pandemic, but more planned approaches should be spearheaded.

As such it subjects the development experience of Kerala for a period of six decades from 1960 to 2020. This exercise reveals that the development experience of Kerala is largely shaped by its historical past which privileged social development over purely economic development based on the growth of the goods producing sectors. State response to social and human development demands were more successful than the conventional efforts to enhance capital formation thereby transforming the material basis of the economy. The high human and social development led to large scale migration of persons, mostly men, to the Gulf countries that resulted in a kind of economic growth induced by outside money in the form of remittances. The national economic context was also one that led to a higher growth of the service sector than the material producing sectors. The limited opportunities afforded by the national state or the increased flow of outside money could not be seized effectively by the regional state to transform goods producing sectors such as agriculture and industry. This resulted in such major and spectacular failures as declining tax collection efficiency, increased net loss of state-owned public enterprises and massive waste of resources in implementing capital projects. I end the article with a call for a study of political economy of development by taking into account the specificities of the Kerala context within a larger national and international context.JEL Codes: O15, R11, F24, J6, H21, H41, H75"

    "abstract": "Since the design and implementation of GST is often perceived as a difficult task, especially in developing countries with federal constitutional structures, the introduction of GST in India in 2017 has been considered a great achievement. Against this background, this article explored the characteristics of India?s GST paradigm from a fiscal federal perspective, its implementation and the tax performance of States under GST. The Indianized GST paradigm, built on the edifice of GST Council and three key pillars of revenue neutrality, tax sharing between the Centre and the States and the provision for GST compensation, has been designed towards fostering cooperative federalism. Our analysis revealed that the revenue neutrality has not been ensured and there were also issues with tax sharing and GST compensation. Both the edifice and the pillars of GST, therefore, were fraught with fault lines in both the design and implementation. Tax effort of the States did not increase indicating that GST has not been helpful in improving the revenue position of the States. Although India?s GST paradigm was destined to foster cooperative federalism the outcomes appear to lead us towards coercive federalism.JEL Codes: H71, H73, H77"

    "abstract": "This article discusses possibilities of transforming the methods of conceiving policy research with a commitment to action, making the process more participatory, accountable and helping the most affected to be part of the decision-making process. It was carried out in the Indian state of Kerala post the devastating 2018 floods caused by unexpected and abnormal precipitation that resulted in severe flooding in 11 out of 14 districts in the state. For the first time, a community feedback mechanism was introduced in the country by the government, using their community structures, resulting in India?s first and largest post-disaster primary database with 19,646 responses. A significant aspect of the study is the inclusion of a large sample (n = 521) of persons with disability. As a methodological innovation, new and dedicated pathways were created for receiving community feedback including grievances from the most marginalised and vulnerable households and individuals. Instituting these within the government itself, to guide the recovery process, was a clear innovation. It suggests that it is possible for a government to listen to the vulnerable within communities and respond while building on their feedback as well as addressing their grievances, which need immediate redressal during disaster recovery."

Supply chain weaknesses have been demonstrated in the past, encouraging the creation of preventative capabilities to retain competitiveness and respond to changes in both macro and local contexts. \n\nExamining the multiple risks presented in the culture and marketing of shrimp, as well as the measures taken by shrimp farmers to overcome the disturbances (producers of the group?s most valuable commodity), could provide insight into the current situation and aid in decision-making. \n\nAgility, distribution network structure, visibility relating producers to final consumers, communication between supply chain partners, sharing of benefits and uncertainties, global mapping, and collaborative actions across supply chain partners were the drivers of supply chain resilience. Uncertainties associated with demand, supply, operational and environmental conditions were identified as supply chain vulnerability factors. The shrimp farmers maintain a balance between dependability measures and risks in the industry and continue the business, knowing that overcoming vulnerability could result in even higher susceptibilities."

Texts and genres are integral to the constitution of a public sphere. The question of a literary public, however, must go beyond one of representation to take into account the question of interpellation. \n\nThis symposium on Gulf–Kerala literary publics looks to acknowledge a nascent body of research-orientated enquiry and to demonstrate a move to read Gulf–Kerala literary connections in new ways. It examines the celebrated novels of Benyamin that circulate globally, notably through translation in the past decade, whilst bringing lesser-known works to our attention. In doing so, the symposium recalibrates the idea of “literary publics” despite the (often restrictive) issues of translation, production costs, or assumed provinciality."

I begin with reflecting on the history of recent feminism in Kerala and then the specific nature of men’s presence, in the next section. In the section that follows, I give an account of the famous debate on feminist writing from this period, popularly known as the pennezhuthu debate, to demonstrate the power relations that structured the positions of men and women within late 1980s–early 1990s feminism. I conclude with some reflections on the present of ‘political feminism’ in Kerala, especially in the wake of the Kiss of Love campaign."

Focusing on the educational gains of Syrian Christian women in Kerala, India, the author provides an intersectional analysis of how religion, class, caste, and gender norms shape education and the potential for empowerment.  The chapter begins by providing an overview of how the human right to education has been taken on by the postcolonial Indian nation-state.  This section is followed by a brief history of “free” and “universal” education and the widening differential access to quality education in Kerala, India.  Using ethnographic research, the author then analyzes religious norms which shape patriarchal attitudes towards women’s property rights and economic empowerment within the Syrian Christian community.  By examining how the intersections between caste, class, religion and gender shape education, the author complicates the link between women’s education and empowerment and questions whether women’s autonomy can be gauged solely through their educational gains."

Through these narratives the venture is also made to explore the spatial geography of Malabar which has been constructed in different times. In addition, it categorizes the two paradigms of ‘knowledge system’ from the mythical-historical Malabar to the colonial constructed Malabar."

These changes namely temporal changes in migration in urban India, reasons for migration, socio-economic status of migrants, work status of migrants, and finally factors influencing the migration in urban India excluding marriage as a reason for migration. Migration in India is mostly influenced by social structure and patterns of development. Education is the most important matter to be considered in inducing rural-urban migration. It is worthwhile to emphasize that while rising economic and social status is associated with higher level of both men's and women's migration in urban areas."

The geographic spread of return emigration follows that of emigration, as return emigration is a follow-up of emigration. The chapter focuses on Kerala's population. Even in the peak of recession, when many of the emigrants were returning home some return emigrants who were already in Kerala, were migrating back to the Gulf. The largest number of emigrants from Kerala lives in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), but the largest number of return emigrants is from Saudi Arabia. The Gulf countries that are relatively more attractive for the Kerala emigrants are Qatar, Bahrain, Oman, UAE, and Kuwait."

    "abstract": "Kerala state in the south-west coast of India is a significant contributor of Indian oil sardine, and also a major consumer of the fish. Indian oil sardine landings in the state declined from 3,22,103 t in 2011 to a meagre 13,154 t in 2020. In the past decade, ring seiners contributed more than 90 per cent of the Indian oil sardine landings in the state, and the livelihoods of small-scale fishers operating ring seiners were largely affected by the decline. \n\nIn this context, an analysis was carried out to study the economic impact of oil sardine decline on the marine fisheries sector and its impacts on livelihood of small-scale fishers. The economic impacts were assessed in terms of changes in gross value and inflation at landing centre and retail levels during 2011–2020. \n\nA survey was conducted at 500 fisher households to assess the livelihood impacts based on loss of employment, income and alternate livelihood options. \n\nThe gross value of oil sardine declined from ₹12,562 million to ₹1,710 million at the landing centre level and from ₹22,869 million to ₹2,687 million at the retail level during 2011–2020. The annual income earned by the fish workers declined from ₹335,593 to ₹90,260 due to the decline in oil sardine landings. \n\nLikert scale analysis of the fisher’s perceptions indicated climate change, over exploitation and marine pollution as the major causes of catch decline. Sixty five per cent of the respondents strongly supported the actions for the protection of fisher’s livelihood and suggested incentive (80% strongly supported) and regulatory (45% strongly supported) based fisheries management measures for sustaining the small-scale fisher’s livelihood."

    "abstract": "Purpose: Transport industry is one of the leading accident causing industries all around the world. Personal attributes like educational qualification, work experience, marital status, consumption of alcohol, hours of work of bus drivers are known to influence such accidents. \n\nIn the present study, the mediating effects of Workplace spirituality (WS) among bus drivers between the personal attributes and job performance variables like self-reported accidents, punishments and appraisals are carried out.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach: A mediation analysis of WS between personal attributes and job performances of bus drivers is conducted in the present study. Since there is scarcity of studies measuring the effects of WS of bus drivers, new scale to measure WS was developed. The study was carried out in the government-owned road transport corporation in the state of Kerala, India. Responses were obtained from 617 male drivers.\n\nFindings: Using exploratory factor analysis, four factors were identified, namely Meaningful work, Sense of Community, Mindfulness and Compassion. Confirmatory factory analysis provided good fit. The intercorrelations of personal attributes of drivers (independent variables) between WS factors (mediating variables) and job performance variables (dependent variables) were found out. Mediation analysis showed complete mediation of WS factors between marital status, alcohol consumption, hours of work and job performances like number of self-reported accidents, punishments and appraisals. The WS levels of drivers decrease significantly as working hours per goes beyond the legally allowed working hours.\n\nOriginality/value: Psychological attributes like Mindfulness, Sense of community, compassion etc. which are collectively known as WS influence the job performances of employees in other industries. Yet it is not studied in the transport industry. Hence, in the present study, the levels of WS are studied among bus drivers of government-owned road transport corporation in the State of Kerala."

    "abstract": "Indoor insect pests have a direct and negative impact on human health by inflicting bites and stings, causing allergic reactions and transmitting diseases. Certain volatile and non-volatile organic compounds, secreted by indoor insect pests, are important components of indoor air quality. Volatile compounds have been associated with numerous health disorders. \n\nIn this study, we used a questionnaire-based approach to quantify the insect populations from 403 indoor spaces along with the features of the indoor systems and the symptoms observed by the inhabitants. We recorded surrounding environmental variables, biological contaminants and possible reasons that the inhabitants thought were behind the increase in the number of certain pests. \n\nThe indoor environment was the second most common reason attributed to the occurrence of indoor illness, likely due to the pandemic. We also found a significant relation between the indoor biological contaminants recorded and the increasing number of illnesses. Although insects were considered a nuisance in many households, they were not found to be directly related to higher numbers of ill inhabitants. Nonetheless, the increasing number of patients with allergies in the past few years and the increasing health issues reported from indoor spaces with higher pest populations indicates their potential impact."

    "abstract": "Landslides are unpredictable and destructive calamities that motivated the development of early warning systems to alert people and save their lives and property. A novel two-layer architecture is proposed to classify and predict landslides and types. \n\nThe research is carried out in the Idukki district, Kerala, India, covering an area of 4358 km2. Layer-1 uses topographical, hydrogeological, and meteorological features collected from various sources. The binary classifier in this layer classifies and predicts the probability of landslide occurrence. Layer-2 classifies landslides into debris flow, rockfall, and surficial slides and predicts debris flow through a multi-class classifier. To achieve better prediction accuracy, the landslide features that significantly influence the landslide occurrence of layer-1 are combined with layer-2. The Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique is used to balance the database of minority categories. \n\nClassification and prediction are achieved using machine learning models such as the support vector machine, decision tree, random forest, and extreme gradient-boosting, and their performances are compared. The feature score for every feature of the model is calculated using the feature importance technique. The machine learning models are validated using the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristics curve and F1-score. \n\nOn comparison, Extreme Gradient-Boost is found to perform well. Based on the prediction probability, the debris flow is classified into high-risk, medium-risk, and low-risk regions. This favoured in identifying vulnerable areas and appropriate mitigation measures to reduce life loss and damage to infrastructure."

    "abstract": "Machine translation is the process of conversion from one language to another using computers. In spite of the existence of several traditional machine translation systems like rule-based, statistical etc., the development of neural machine translation has significantly improved translation quality. However, the morphological richness and agglutinative nature of Indian languages hampers the usage of neural machine translation for translation among Indian languages despite its potential to overcome the difficulties posed by conventional translation systems. Hence the combination of neural machine translation with morphology, part of speech tagger and word sense disambiguation is proposed to address these challenges and adapt it for bidirectional translation between Sanskrit and Malayalam. \n\nConventional neural machine translations are unimodal systems that utilise textual data for translation. Translation quality of conventional neural machine translation is enhanced with a novel multimodal bidirectional neural machine translation system with text & speech as the two modalities based on parallel text corpus and speech database. \n\nThe best performance score is obtained for two-level fusion, the feature vectors extracted from speech signals using different transforms (Wavelet transform, 1-D sequency mapped real transform & 1-D GCD based mapped real transform) are fused and which is further fused with a context vector from the text modality. Automatic and manual review methods are employed to assess quality of translation. \n\nFindings from the experiments reveal that addition of speech modality improved the overall quality of translation. BLEU scores of 43.89 and 42.72 are obtained for Sanskrit to Malayalam and Malayalam to Sanskrit multimodal translation respectively."

    "abstract": "Many rituals in North Malabar can be read as complex cultural spaces that articulate subaltern concerns to a certain extent. However, rituals also perpetuate hegemonic ideologies dictated by and embedded within the caste system. \n\nTheyyam, a traditional ritual art in North Malabar, carries ritualistic elements of worship and penance along with the convergence of various forms like dance, painting and music. In Theyyam, a traditional ritual art in North Malabar, the female impersonation of the Mother Goddess and female deities occurs in the transvestite ritualistic performances by men. \n\nDevakkooth, or the dance of the goddess, a ritual art performed in an islet or thuruth, is widely regarded as the only Theyyam performed by women from the Malaya community, where women impersonate the goddess. Devakkooth is different from other performing arts because of its performance style and self-reflexivity on the thuruth culture. \n\nThis article discusses key aspects of Devakkooth: the myth, the song of the performance, body movements, geographical specialities and its cultural and ritualistic self-reflexivity. This paper explores the unique aspects of Devakkooth as a female performance artistic dance ritual."

Here, central agencies, think tanks and non-governmental organisations reinforce this form of liberal perspectives, but also, such frames are reinforced by international collaborative projects with researchers of progressive ideological positions seeking to simplistically bring back the welfare state with little understanding of power structures on the ground. Here, groups termed at risk and marginal in line with ideas of southern epistemologies emphasise their political agency as particular constellations and varied material realms. \n\nTo counter these ideas, we focus on the spatialities associated with various material practices. Without this, attempts to provincialise development in contexts such as Alappad are essentialising and de-politicising."

The present study aims at assessing the level of anxiety, depression and social support of the LGBTIQ communities during the COVID-19. Since the ‘LGBTIQ’ community is an integral part of society, it is necessary to study these psychological dimensions in the face of multiple waves of the pandemic in the country.\n\nAim: The study aims to measure the anxiety, depression and social support of LGBTIQ during COVID-19 in Kerala.\n\nMethod: The study followed descriptive research design and using snowball sampling, total of 106 respondents were interviewed from the urban and rural areas of Kerala. The researchers used the ‘DASS21’ to assess anxiety and depression and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support to assess social support.\n\nResults: Approximately half (44.3%) of the participants were experiencing severe or extremely severe levels of depression. At the same time, many of them had episodes of anxiety disorder at much higher levels (41.5%) than the other members of society. Perceived social support was negatively correlated with depression, anxiety and stress, while depression, anxiety and stress showed a positive correlation with each other.\n\nConclusion: Common mental health problems such as anxiety, depression and stress were largely prevalent in the LGBTIQ community during COVID-19, who found the social support inadequate and suffered from other social and economic problems. There is a need to address these issues among this population."

    "abstract": "In this article, we reflect on the consequences of COVID-19 interventions on coastal communities in south Kerala (India), and the responses of the local population to the latter. In particular, we map out the events which led to spontaneous protests in a number of fishing villages during the second wave of the epidemic in July 2020. \n\nWe will show that whilst during the first wave of the epidemic, coastal communities remained supportive of government intervention, such an initial support begun to wane as the epidemic unfolded over time and became more aggressive and widespread. \n\nWe argue that such a shift in fishing communities’ attitudes was a response not only to the consequences of a more forceful policy of containment of the epidemic but also to a sudden identification of coastal communities as the main locus of contagion in the district. \n\nWe suggest that the consequent restrictive measures enforced on coastal communities were driven as much by epidemiological concerns as by a media-driven social panic built upon widespread negative stereotypes that have historically worked to marginalise, and even criminalise coastal communities in Kerala. \n\nWe deploy the notion of bio-moral marginality to reveal ways through which the attribution of specific—and largely stereotyped and negative— physical attributes and moral dispositions to the bodies and behaviour of people belonging to fishing coastal communities constituted the ground upon which the social panic concerning the spread of the COVID-19 virus unfolded in south Kerala, thus leading to fishers’ militant response."

    "abstract": "Some of the most crucial debates surrounding Islamic legitimacy and cinema rotate around the question of the permissible (ḥalāl) and prohibited (ḥarām) in Islamic law and how these function for Muslim theology and politics. Emerging from these debates, halal cinema has been one of the recent critical interventions in the field of Indian and Islamic cinema. Rather than making cinema Islamic from an ideological position, the new halal experiments with the visual language of cinema without compromising the popular dimensions of its viewership. \n\nThis article looks at the politics of halal cinema within the context of the state of Kerala in South India and argues that the space of halal cinema shows the aspirations and negotiations of the Muslim community in Kerala. Halal cinema thus becomes an immanent critique of Islamic cinema by destabilising the dominant practice that connects the relationship between Islam and cinema."

It also explores whether boundary management strategies vary based on motherhood and business stages. \n\nWe explored these issues by interviewing 25 financially successful well-educated women entrepreneurs from five cities (Chennai, Bengaluru, Delhi, Hyderabad, and Cochin) in India. \n\nWe found that mothers with younger children and entrepreneurs in the early stages of the business preferred to integrate work and family roles than to set a clear boundary between the roles, using various boundary management tactics to achieve work-life balance (WLB). They attempted to minimise imbalance by creating a resource pool, flexible scheduling, working fewer hours, and preferring workplace proximity. Social support seemed to be essential to reconcile the multiple role demands. \n\nAccording to the business and motherhood stages, significant differences were observed in the type and level of WLB issues women face. The study provides recommendations for successful reconciliation between the work and non-work lives in the Indian context. In this culturally unique context, while access to institutional support for women entrepreneurs is meager, any effort to help them reconcile their work and family demands will be helpful."

This, in turn, is triggering landslides and floods in the Western Ghats of Kerala. \n\nAccordingly, this study analyses the assessment and distribution of household level vulnerability toward climate change among the occupational categories in the Western Ghats of Kerala. \n\nBased on landslide data of Kerala for the years 2018 and 2019, five villages from Idukki District, which accounts for the highest number of landslides, are selected as the study region. \n\nThe landslides and floods have either entirely or partially destroyed 3,367 households in the study region during 2018 and 2019. Among these, 348 families are chosen for the study. \n\nWe have adopted a stratified random sampling technique. The households belonging to all occupational categories are included in the sample. To facilitate the analysis, we have developed the concept of adaptive capacity entitlement to analyse the household-level vulnerability differences among occupational categories. Accordingly, data is elicited using an interview schedule and analysed using robust logistic regression models. \n\nThe results show that agrarian households are significantly vulnerable to landslides and floods. Among agrarian households, agricultural labourers tend to be the most vulnerable. A substantial number of agricultural labourer households live in hazard-prone regions, resulting in unequally distributed exposure to climatic hazards. \n\nThe study reveals that the family's historic wealth (landholding) plays a significant role in households' capacity to attain entitlement. Besides, the entitlement enables the household to migrate to safer locations. \n\nThe study highlights the need to frame a holistic climate adaptation policy for the region. For this reason, a sustainable land use policy has to be developed. Consequently, we recommend further studies to analyse the prospects and challenges of rehabilitation as well as land use regulation policies."

    "abstract": "In response to the global call to upscale mental health services in low-­income countries, mental health non-governmental organisations (MHNGOs) have sprung up in Kerala to address mental health needs by partnering with pre-existing locally grown, bottom-up, community-led pain and palliative clinics (PPCs) to increase access to mental health care through task-shifting. \n\nThe MHNGOs mandate filtering only patients with ‘severe mental disorders’ from low socioeconomic backgrounds for their free services. This eligibility criterion mandated by the MHNGO is ruffling feathers within the palliative clinics that oppose such ­classifications. They believe that suffering cuts across all divisions and should not be discriminated against based on economic background and severity of illnesses. \n\nWhen chronicity and suffering are held universal by the MHNGO and palliative care, respectively, it brings to the fore the enactment of two perspectives of care. Drawing on observations of clinical interactions between patients, MHNGO staff and mental health professionals and interviews with community volunteers of palliative care clinics in Kerala, this paper demonstrates how chronicity narrative promoted by MHNGOs based on biopsychiatric model gains hegemony, whereas the community care model loses traction progressively. \n\nThe state, caught between these two narratives, frontstages development by submitting its health machinery to the MHNGOs flouting basic medical safety laws in its services to marginalised people like the tribal population. \n\nThis paper argues that the rising dominance of chronicity narrative in community mental health clinics as well as in popular media discourses evolves out of power relations between the MHNGOs and the palliative clinics."

    "abstract": "Abstract This chapter traces South Asian loanwords in the Austronesian and Papuan languages of Maritime Southeast Asia. The relevant donor languages encompass two language families: Indo-European (specifically Indo-Aryan) and Dravidian (specifically South Dravidian). Among the former, Sanskrit has had the greatest impact in Maritime Southeast Asia. From the South Dravidian side, a significant layer of loanwords came from Tamil, whereas Malayalam donated a comparatively smaller amount of vocabulary. The vast majority of South Asian loanwords spread eastwards through Malay and to a lesser degree through Javanese, although direct contact can be seen in the local languages of North Sumatra. Especially the oldest forms of Javanese, in which many written texts have been preserved, are informative about the phonological and semantic developments of borrowed (and inherited) vocabulary in Maritime Southeast Asia. South Asian loanwords in this region (and beyond) encompass introduced items but also borrowed words for existing concepts. For the languages of Sumatra, Java, and elsewhere within the sphere of direct Indian influence, the lexical record reflects a profound impact from South Asian languages. Further to the east, only the most practical borrowings remain, all transmitted through intermediate languages. In the Papuan languages, specifically the Timor-Alor-Pantar and North Halmahera families, lexical influence from Indo-Aryan and South Dravidian languages is minimal and chiefly of recent date."

    "abstract": "This chapter revolves around scales of justice and their shifts in instances of political violence. Drawing on court records and ethnography of trials involving members of the party Left and Hindu Right in South India, I examine the relationship between democratic legitimacy and the acts of scaling down and scaling up judicial responsibility for political violence. \n\nComparisons with legal proceedings in the wake of the 2002 pogrom of Muslims in Gujarat, the 1984 anti-Sikh violence in Delhi, justifications that the Indian state has offered to promulgate extraordinary laws, and renderings of democracy as majoritarian rule become important here. They help us analyze the stakes underlying judicial individuation and de-individualization of political violence, and the contexts in which the Indian legal system has shifted from one scale of responsibility to another. Each instance gives us the opportunity to reflect on the relationship between violence, law, and the modern democratic order."

    "abstract": "The paper attempts to understand the idea of readership and access to printed books in colonial South India, responding to print and missionary interventions in nineteenth-century Kerala. The paper would ask, how does one work with traces of reading in the text and construct its beyond with interest in this history, paying heed to its entanglements in desires and fears of and from the same activity of reading? Is there a potential affective space in this history, accounted by the reader between divisions of the material text and the liminalities of reading events scattered in its time and space? The paper envisions methods to study reading and its lives by imaginatively and symbolically locating “readers” and “respondents” to the changes within the nineteenth-century missionary printing exercise. The study understands the coming of Vidyasamgraham or The Cottayam College Quarterly Magazine, published between 1864 and 1867 to have set the pace for both knowledge dissemination and the making of rational modern “reading” subjects in nineteenth-century Kerala. The serialization of The Slayer Slain throughout its eight issues will be read alongside the selected entries of Vidyasamgraham to ask questions about how reading was conceived, its locations, and the nature of the book."

    "abstract": "This paper looks at a case of rural-to-rural movement of agrarian capital in southern India and the ways in which capital–labour relations are reworked to maintain oppressive forms of exploitation. Faced with an agrarian crisis, capitalist farmers from affluent communities of Wayanad, Kerala, take large tracts of land for lease in the neighbouring state of Karnataka and grow ginger based on price speculation. Landless Adivasis from Wayanad have served as labourers on these ginger farmlands for the past three decades. Recently, farmers have shifted to employing labourers from a Scheduled Caste (SC) from Karnataka. The change happened not just because of the lower wages the SC labourers were willing to work for but also because of the farmers' inclination to move away from Adivasis who have been resisting the poor working conditions on the farm. The story resonates with the broader dynamics of agrarian–labour relations amidst capitalist expansion and highlights the centrality of socio-political factors at play."

We inform solidarity studies by illustrating how solidarity-making pulsates infrastructures with diverse webs of relations and spatial configurations. \n\nOverall, we advance a generative engagement with heterogeneity in institutional analyses and discuss the implications of solidarity-making to address infrastructural inequalities."

It looks at a women’s shelter run by a missionary wife Julie Gundert of the Basel Mission in nineteenth-century Malabar. \n\nThe missionaries played a key role in the introduction of printing and the development of a modern public sphere in the region: a space, nevertheless, restricted to men from the educated elite classes. Julie’s shelter, meanwhile, provides an alternate cultural space where women, especially those from the excluded communities, the disabled, the abandoned and the lowest classes and castes could come together. \n\nThe shelter is seen as a location of intimate and privatised cultural contact radically different from that practised in the formal, restrictive sites of the emerging public sphere; a space where subaltern cultures challenged the status of the visible public sphere as the key platform for social-cultural inclusion and agency."

This was remarkable in the face of the fact that healthcare systems were stretched the world over and were struggling beyond capacity to treat the number of people affected by the virus. To add to the overstretched healthcare systems, there were reports of attacks on healthcare workers and facilities. \n\nThe state of Kerala was among the first to report a coronavirus case in January 2020. Against this backdrop, Kerala’s approach to mobilise the state’s resources, particularly the police, ran counter to that of many other states and their demands for assistance and financial support from the central government. This article details how one state addressed the problem during a national and international crisis. \n\nIt includes a review of Kerala’s lateral thinking and successful case studies from the field. This research provides strategic thinking and solutions that other states could potentially follow when dealing with pandemics within their borders, both today and in the future."

Moreover, analysing its diverse modes locates prayer within the networks and relationships of the congregational community, thereby engaging Foucault’s subjectivation with Latour’s actant."

The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, multiple regression analysis, and an independent t-test. \n\nResults indicated that exposure to parental IPV and demographic variables such as parents’ education, occupation, and family income significantly predict self-esteem in adolescents. Moreover, high exposure to parental IPV may cause low self-esteem in adolescents. School and family-based online interventions are needed to protect IPV-affected adolescents and enhance their self-esteem."

Commonest complication was thrombosis followed by infection, either PICC-associated bloodstream infection (PABSI) or local infection (LI). PABSI noted in this study was 1.34 per 1000 catheter days. The majority (85%) of PABSI were due to Gram-negative rods. The average duration of PICC days for occurrence of PABSI was 14 days and the majority occurred in in-patients.\n\nConclusion: Thrombosis and infection were the commonest PICC-related complications.

    "abstract": "The feminist play <i>Kali Natakam</i> by Sajitha Madathil explores the injustices encountered by women in a ‘progressive society’ through Mudiyettu, a ritual dance performed in Kali Temples in Central Kerala. But is gender inequality the only visible problem in the play? Do mainstream feminist studies overshadow the issue of caste discrimination? \n\nMadathil’s play is studied using the framework of Dalit feminism to understand the triple oppression Dalit women experience based on their caste, gender, and race differences. Through an amalgamation of the myth of Kali and Darika, and a portrayal of contemporary society, the play complicates the notion of gender and caste discrimination. \n\nThis article uses the concept of ‘intersectionality,’ introduced by Kimberlé Crenshaw in 1989, to understand the play in the dimensions of gender, caste, and race. The basis of Dalit feminism is the testimonies given by Dalit women revealing how their everyday lives differed from those of non-Dalit women. First-person narratives lead in building the canvas of feminist thought in connection with caste identity. And how monopolising gender by sideling race and caste differences ends in shunning some of the significant concerns and problems of women of different communities, especially Dalits. \n\nConsidering the gender and caste element, a Dalit feminist analysis becomes the most appropriate way to study the play instead of doing separate studies. Recognising the intersectionality in the play leads to comprehending the complexities of discrimination operating at multiple levels."

Young people aged below 18 years who were just about to start orthodontic treatment were invited to complete the Malayalam version of MIQ along with the available native version of the Psychosocial Impact of Dental Aesthetics Questionnaire (PIDAQ). The MIQ-Malayalam was readministered after 14 days to assess test-retest reliability. Treatment need was assessed normatively using the Dental Health Component of the Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need (IOTN-DHC) and subjectively using Aesthetic Component of the Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need (IOTN-AC).\n\nResults: A total of 210 subjects completed the questionnaires (males = 47.2%; females = 52.8%; age = 12-17 years, mean = 15 years and 3 months; standard deviation = 1.9) and 50 completed repeat questionnaires. Internal consistency and test-retest reliability were high (Cronbach's alpha = 0.952; Intra-class Correlation Coefficient = 0.93). Exploratory factor analysis derived 4 factors with exclusion of 1 item. There were significant differences (P < .05) in MIQ scores between IOTN-DHC subgroups, ensuring discriminant validity. There was a high correlation between total MIQ and total PIDAQ scores (rho = 0.884), while low between total MIQ and IOTN-AC scores (rho = 0.203).\n\nConclusion: The Malayalam version of MIQ was found to be valid and reliable and can serve as a useful condition-specific measure of oral health-related quality of life."

Furthermore, the study analyses the influence of gender and type of business on SC, entrepreneurial self-efficacy, and OR. \n\nData were collected through a cross-sectional survey among micro-entrepreneurs in Kerala, India. Independent sample Z-test and structural equation modeling were used to analyse the data.\n\nThe results reveal that entrepreneurial self-efficacy mediates the relationship between SC and OR. Sobel test was used to reaffirm the mediation effect. \n\nThis study provides suggestions for enhancing entrepreneurial self-efficacy to better identify opportunities in today’s ever-changing global business environment."

As a result, the democratic rights of the news workers in their working atmosphere have also not been addressed. \n\nIn this context, this study explores the labour condition of television news workers in privately-owned native language news channels in the southern state of Kerala. In-depth interviews with working journalists, former employees, and office bearers of major journalists’ trade unions help to analyse to what extent the news workers have the freedom to express their dissent inside their organisation. \n\nThe study found that the profit-oriented restructuring in the technology and labour process has embarked on far-reaching labour issues, which points to holistic problems that undermine the basic tenets of journalism and human rights. Issues such as weakened editorial boards, the inclusion of marketing representatives in the editorial, and direct intervention by the management are destroying a democratic atmosphere in the newsroom. These scenarios intensify other democratic issues, such as the individual freedom of a journalist to express their dissent in the workspace."

    "abstract": "Stuart Blackburn takes the reader inside a little-known form of shadow puppetry in this captivating work about performing the Tamil version of the Ramayana epic. Blackburn describes the skill and physical stamina of the puppeteers in Kerala state in South India as they perform all night for as many as ten weeks during the festival season. The fact that these performances often take place without an audience forms the starting point for Blackburn's discussion - one which explores not only this important epic tale and its performance, but also the broader theoretical issues of text, interpretation, and audience.Blackburn demonstrates how the performers adapt the narrative and add their own commentary to re-create the story from a folk perspective. At a time when the Rama story is used to mobilize political movements in India, the puppeteers' elaborate recitation and commentary presents this controversial tale from another ethical perspective, one that advocates moral reciprocity and balance.While the study of folk narrative has until now focused on tales, tellers, and tellings, this work explores the importance of audience--absent or otherwise. Blackburn's elegant translations of the most dramatic and pivotal sequences of the story enhance our appreciation of this unique example of performance art."

Environmental risk factors for dengue also vary widely across geographic settings. \n\nOur aim was to study the test positivity rate of the World Health Organization (WHO) 2009 probable dengue case definition and to suggest region-specific improvisations to it. The study also analyses the sociodemographic and environmental risk factors of dengue fever in South Kerala, India.\n\nA case–control study was conducted in South Kerala from 2017 to 2019. Dengue reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-positive and RT-PCR-negative ‘probable dengue’ patients were compared to identify significant symptoms for a modified definition of dengue. A group of afebrile community controls was compared with RT-PCR-positive dengue cases to study the environmental and behavioural risk factors. \n\nArthralgia, palmar erythema and rashes have high discriminatory power (odds ratio [OR] &gt;3) for identifying dengue. Redness of eyes, altered consciousness, abdominal distension and chills were found to moderately discriminate (OR 2–3) dengue. The adjusted analysis showed the presence of mosquito breeding sites (indoor p=0.02, outdoor p=0.03), solid waste dumping (p&lt;0.001) and open water drainage in the compound (p=0.007) as significant predictors.\n\nRegional modifications should be considered when using the WHO definition in endemic settings. Control of mosquito breeding at the household level is the key towards dengue prevention."

    "abstract": "Coastal erosion has long been identified as a cause of concern for the state of Kerala, situated in the Indian subcontinent, affecting the life and livelihood of millions residing in the coastal belt. The increased human interference supplemented by changes in the climatic pattern in recent years has modified the coastal scenario of the state altogether. The present study attempts to evaluate the effect of anthropogenic influences in modifying the coastal scenario to review the efficiency of the coastal management policy adopted by the state over the years. For this purpose, the shorelines extracted from the available multi-temporal satellite images are analysed using DSAS software to calculate the shoreline change rate prior to 2000 (1973-98) and post-2000 (2002-21) using the linear rate of regression method. The study seeks to key out critically eroding areas, subsequently exploring the possible conducive reasons for the changed coastal scenario. The results indicate a reduction of 34.5% in the share of eroding length, with a visible shift in a substantial portion of coastal stretch from the mild erosion category to the stable category. Despite the state's continuous efforts to curb the issue, the long-term shoreline change over the past 49 years (1973–2021) reveals erosion to be dominant in nearly 39.12% of the coastal length, with the share of eroding length in the southern, central and northern regions as 33.8%, 38.67% and 44.04%, respectively. The results point towards the dominance of human interventions accompanied by climate change impacts as the primary reason for transforming the coast, necessitating the need to modify the state's current coastal management policy. The research emphasises the need for a comprehensive coastal management plan for the state to take heed of the changing climatic scenario."

    "abstract": "This paper examines how Indian migrant families in Dubai actively sustain mobile livelihoods across the Indian Ocean and beyond, paying attention to the role played by education in the unfolding of such migrant lives. This paper aims to nuance the experiences of Gulf migrants that have broadly focused on systemic vulnerabilities produced by the legal, economic and social structures encountered in Gulf destinations. \n\nThis paper builds on the stories of three families from the southern Indian state of Kerala with diverse mobility trajectories over time and space, which is conceptualised in relation to the practice of specific livelihoods, focusing on the patterns and impacts of mobility at different life stages and across generations. Literature engaging with the migration-education nexus, which reveals that education is an integral part of mobile livelihoods worldwide, provides an analytical backdrop. \n\nThe paper shows distinct ways in which education forms a crucial part of complex agendas, informing family migration to and from the Gulf region. Furthermore, it captures how migrants’ educational agendas are continuously being adjusted in processes of migration, and how this relates to the ongoing transformation of individual and collective social identities and the remaking of mobile livelihoods."

    "abstract": "Background: Sharing research findings with participants is recognised as an ethical imperative for the research community. However, most discourse on this topic in mainstream public health takes a paternalistic approach, with researchers retaining the power to choose if, when, and how research findings are shared. \n\nMethods: Fieldwork took place from August 2018 to January 2019 and again from August 2019 to December 2019 among two communities in the south Indian state of Kerala. We integrated participant engagement with study findings into the research protocol, using various collaborative strategies identified during the design stage, forming partnerships with participants and determining appropriate forms of dissemination for different participant groups during fieldwork. \n\nResults: Findings from previous research projects undertaken with these communities by other researchers had not been shared with them. This was interpreted by the communities as researchers not being interested in making a difference to their situation. In the current study, building reciprocal relationships that minimised power disparities, and providing outputs in tailored formats that promoted active engagement were key factors that enabled participants to engage with results. This engagement added value by enabling us to co-develop study recommendations. This process also enabled the community to have ownership of the results and use them to advocate for health system change to improve access to health care. \n\nConclusion: Research should be transformative for participating communities. Participants have a right to know the results of the research they participate in since their knowledge provides the research data which can in turn promote community change. Operationalising this requires researchers to build partnerships with participants and their communities from the outset. The role of participants must be reimagined, and adequate resources should be built into the research process. This is both socially responsible and ethical, but also improves the impact and legitimacy of research for the participants and the communities that they represent. \n\nPatient or Public Contribution: Participants of our research contributed to the design of various aspects of the engagement processes including the venue, the formats used for engagement, interpretation of the findings and recommendations from our research."

This study investigated the influence and participation of inpatients in infection-related care, including antibiotic decision-making, within and across two tertiary hospitals in South Africa (Cape Town) and India (Kerala). \n\nMethods: Through ethnographic enquiry of clinical practice in surgical pathways, including direct nonparticipant observation of clinical practices, healthcare worker (HCW), patient and carer interactions in surgical ward rounds and face-to-face interviews with participants (HCWs and patients), we sought to capture the implicit and explicit influence that patients and carers have in infection-related care. Field notes and interview transcripts were thematically coded, aided by NVivo 12® Pro software. \n\nResults: Whilst observational data revealed the nuanced roles that patients/carers play in antibiotic decision-making, HCWs did not recognise these roles. Patients and carers, though invested in patient care, are not routinely involved, nor are they aware of the opportunities for engagement in infection-related decision-making. Patients associated clinical improvement with antibiotic use and did not consider hospitalisation to be associated with infection acquisition or transmission, highlighting a lack of understanding of the threat of infection and antibiotic resistance. Patients' economic and cultural positionalities may influence their infection-related behaviours. In the study site in India, cultural norms mean that carers play widespread but unrecognised roles in inpatient care, participating in infection prevention activities. \n\nConclusion: For patients to have a valuable role in AS and make informed decisions regarding their infection-related care, a mutual understanding of their role in this process among HCWs and patients is crucial. The observed differences between the two study sites indicate the critical need for understanding and addressing the contextual drivers that impact effective patient-centred healthcare delivery. \n\nPatient or Public Contribution: Ethnographic observations and interviews conducted in this study involved patients as participants. Patients were recruited for interviews after obtaining signed informed consent forms. Patients' identities were completely anonymized when presenting the study findings."

They trace their origins to Jesus’s apostle Thomas, who they believe visited India in 52 ce and established a church there. From the third century on, through trade, migration, and exchanges of ecclesiastical personnel, the lives of the Thomas Christians and Persian Christians became intertwined. Gradually, the Thomas Christians fell under the oversight of the Church of the East, whose capital was at Sasanian Ctesiphon. The ties of Thomas Christians to the Church of the East did not make them any less anchored in south Indian society. Their interactions with Persian Christians went hand in hand with their coexistence with Hindu and Muslim neighbors in the coastal region of southwest India now called Kerala—a dual participation that continues to the present day."

    "abstract": "In recent times, increased rainfall from tropical cyclones due to climate change affects the agricultural sector, mainly the paddy fields. High windspeed with excessive rain causes lodging of paddy crops, which is difficult to harvest. \n\nMechanised harvesting systems are ineffective in this situation due to waterlogging in the fields. Manual harvesting with a traditional sickle is the only way to harvest lodged crops to save food security crises and economic losses. Collecting the lodged paddy stems lying on the ground for harvesting manually is time-consuming and harvesters need to maintain an awkward posture for a prolonged period compared to harvesting un-lodged crops.\n\nMethods: Seventy-five female harvesters aged 35–75 years were selected for the study from both lodged and un-lodged small-scale farming lands of Kerala, a southwestern coastal state of India. A comparative ergonomic assessment was conducted to measure body pain, perceived exertion, postural risks, and rate of production under both harvesting conditions.\n\nResults: The harvesters reported significant higher rates of body pain, perceived exertion, high postural risks, and low productivity in lodged conditions compared to un-lodged condition.\n\nConclusion: Harvesting lodged crops involves high risks with low productivity and needs immediate ergonomic design intervention for the well-being of the harvesters."

    "abstract": "Mangroves, wetlands, and coral reefs are dynamic ecosystems that are easily affected by natural calamities as well as human interferences. The 2004 tsunami improved awareness on the need to conserve and sustainably manage the mangroves. Therefore, mangrove areas are categorised as ecologically sensitive under the Indian coastal regulatory zone notification I (CRZ-I) in 2011. \n\nAn accurate delineation of mangrove areas is important for its in situ conservation. Satellite remote sensing data and geographical information system (GIS) tools can be effectively used to define the boundary of mangrove patches. The advantages are that these are less expensive and less time-consuming than in situ sampling of individual patches. \n\nIn the present study, we used Google Earth Pro image search engine, Quantum GIS (Version QGIS 3.10) and SNAP (Sentinel Application Platform Version 8.0)—all open-source GIS softwares to map the distribution and features of mangrove areas. Cloud-free Sentinel-2 multispectral images (MSI) were acquired from the Copernicus data hub hosted by the European Space Agency (ESA). The pre-processing of satellite data and classification using the Random Forest (RF) method were carried out in SNAP and semi-automated classification using the maximum likelihood classification (MLC) method in QGIS. \n\nThe pixel-based RF classification using Sentinel-2 satellite in SNAP showed the highest accuracy based on Cohen’s kappa coefficient (K) among the three classification algorithms (RF (K = 0.80), MLC (K = 0.68) and K-nearest neighbour (K = 0.61) methods), followed by semi-automated classification in QGIS and Google Earth image-based classification. \n\nThe pixel-based RF classification enables the fine classification of mangroves from other vegetation. These outputs are field verified with the ground control points (GCPs), collected during an extensive field survey along the coastal districts of Kerala. \n\nThe successful methodology was employed to delineate the entire mangrove patches throughout the coastal regions of Kerala. This methodology can be adopted for mapping mangroves in the remaining coastal states of India to make an appropriate mangrove distribution library for India. This would help make a successful conservation plan to protect the diminishing mangrove forests in India. \n\nThis book chapter highlights the utilisation of advanced techniques in satellite remote sensing and GIS for better management of mangroves all across the globe."

Wetlands in the Southern Kerala district (SKD) have a great natural wetlands ecosystem, but it is not well detailed. The present study investigates the anthropogenic factors that shift the ecological status (ES) of wetlands in the SKD because few surveys have been carried out. Seventy-five chosen wetlands were surveyed by a range of methods at five different districts, namely Alappuzha, Ernakulam, Kottayam, Thrissur, and Palakkad districts. Results revealed that most were hydrologically isolated wetlands, and a few were semi-parched in the summer. Dominant forms of wetlands were five acres in size. The human disturbance scores (HDS) showed that the Alappuzha district wetlands was high impacted (HI), the Palakkad district wetlands was mid impacted (MI), and the rest of the district wetlands were in the least impacted (LI) category. Overall, the population around the wetland habitat indicated 500 individuals were common in all wetlands. The Pearson correlation results revealed a statistically significant, positive interaction between the wetland habitat population and the HDS scores noted in riverine wetlands (n = 48), (r = 0.058, p <= 0.687) and palustrine wetlands (n = 13), (r = 0.817, p > 0.000). Also, the correlation test was not significant in Lacustrine wetlands (n = 8), (r = −0.21, p < .954). However, anthropogenic activities caused the all the wetland degradation. The factor-wise degradation of wetlands differs among the districts. The results propose fundamental details on the anthropogenic factors that impact the ecological status of wetlands in SKD, which will aid the extent of regional strategies for wetlands management."

    "abstract": "Urban river restoration is an emerging challenge across the world. Several countries are in the process of executing various restoration programmes. However, often the thrust of restoration activities is on technical measures with little or no scope for social interventions. This has not produced desired results, and the need for a paradigm shift is globally felt. It is realised that social and ecological issues are equally important as most of the ecological problems are of societal origin. The co-evolutionary approach advocated in recent years stresses the consideration of both social and ecological issues and stakeholder participation. Examining two case studies from Kerala, India, this paper argues that the participatory approach has the potential to emerge as the viable alternative for urban river restoration under the co-evolutionary framework. The methodological challenges are context-specific, however, there is a need for a broad policy framework and strategic plan covering a wide range of activities from the campaign, conscientisation to plot-level intervention."

It is this quality of his fictions as well as the linguistic innovations that accompanied their composition that makes him a legendary storyteller of our times. In spite of Vijayan’s life-long interest in such basic issues as individual freedom and the corruption of those in power, the chapter identifies two phases in Vijayan’s career as a fictionist, each articulating a separate world of experience. The first phase represents the attitude of a sceptic visionary who is fascinated by the materiality of language and allows writing to be governed by the culture’s dialogism and narrative pluralism. The second phase is marked by Vijayan’s metaphysical proclivities, which can be seen reflected in his philosophy of certitude and the guru principle that his novels and short stories articulated during this period."

    "abstract": "This chapter discusses the literary output of S.K. Pottekkat, fictionist and travel writer, who thought of himself basically as a writer of romantic fiction. A serious chronicler of his times, Pottekkat is one of the early Indian writers to internalise the everyday context of modernity into his practice of writing. \n\nAs a travel writer, he is a pioneering figure in bhasha writing. While travel in a literal sense offered him opportunities to get to know people and places, in a metaphorical sense it offered him room for mobility and mental expansion, which must have permitted him to see modernity in a new light. \n\nWriting, for Pottekkat, is surrogate travel, perhaps an act of fantasy travel, which brings the writer and the reader together, and then drives both into contact with new and strange environments."

    "abstract": "The chapter examines the element of bilingualism in relation to Indian literatures as they attempt to articulate questions concerning the everyday. The chapter has a special focus on Indian English literature, as it is with reference to this branch of Indian writing that bilingualism is often raised as a point of debate. The chapter also deals with the schism in modernity, as crucial to the debate carried out here is the identification of a maimed language that is directly connected to English’s emotional aloofness from Indian bhashas. The argument in the chapter is illustrated with the help of two specimens of Indian writing: Mulk Raj Anand’s social realist novel, Untouchable, and Vaikom Muhammad Basheer’s short story on the everyday, ‘Janmadinam’."

    "abstract": "This chapter explores the possibilities of developing an alternative and critical literary historiography that would stay clear of modernity’s colonial cultural baggage, which trammels available models of non-western literary historiography.\n\nUsing M. Leelavathy’s genre-based history of Malayalam poetry titled Malayala Kavita Sahitya Charitram as a point of reference, the chapter tries to rethink literary history’s Euro-centric methodology of reading bhasha literary texts as mirror images of colonial literary texts. Literary history’s practice of using the western template for interpreting the evolution of Indian literary history through such expressions as ‘romanticism’ and ‘modernism’ is also subjected to interrogation. The chapter argues that though Leelavathy’s literary history does not openly defy the protocols of conventional literary historiography, it can be said to carry within its unconscious the seeds of a truly critical literary history for Indian bhashas."

As literature originating from the geographical area lying outside the boundaries of the Hindi heartland, the conflict in the relationship could certainly be seen as related to the political tension existing between diverse bhasha communities on the question of the idea of India. In one sense, it is modernity’s schism that surfaces as the rift between the local and the national in the poetry reviewed. However, the discussion also demonstrates that the democratic and egalitarian spirit that underlies bhasha literatures is strong enough to thwart attempts at cultural tyranny by the advocates of hyper-nationalism."

Kesari’s critical essays and journalism illustrate the divide in the Indian mind that arose from its contact with colonial modernity. The divide is evident in the writer’s critical assimilation of the East-West split and his conception of immanent experience and the art of the present, both of which can be integrated into his larger vision of an implied indigenous modernity geared to his unique idea of progress and secularism."

We argue that a “politics of empty space” operating in the policy narratives and the practices have resulted in a partial decommodification of rural waters in Kerala. The communities, especially the oppressed and the marginalised, have managed to co-produce ecological assets like rural ponds. Such efforts towards re-embedding the economy in the society could be a starting point to address the water and the larger environmental crisis that we are in today."

Referring to her short stories and her 2016 novel Bicycle Dreaming, she discusses her interest in small lives and unexceptional characters. She shares her dissatisfaction with Indian contemporary literature in English that portrays the working class in a way that satisfies the curiosity of middle-class readers but fails to engage with a larger readership. On the other hand, she praises the scope of Indian literature in other languages, especially in Malayalam and Tamil."

    "abstract": "Background: In India, indigenous populations, known as Tribes, are among the poorest and most marginalised groups. We estimated the prevalence of smoking, alcohol use, and betel quid chewing and examined the association between gender and smoking, alcohol use, and betel quid chewing among Kattunayakan primitive tribes who are categorised as a Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG) in the Kerala state of India.\n\nMethods: A secondary analysis of a sample of the Wayanad District Tribal Household survey comprising 388 Kattunayakan PVTG households selected through multistage cluster random sampling was undertaken. Binary logistic regression models were used to estimate an association between gender and smoking, alcohol use, and betel quid chewing in these tribal households.\n\nResults: Mean age was 39.2 years (±15.1), more than three-fourths of the respondents were female (75.3%), and approximately 24% of the respondents reported smoking tobacco in past 12 months. A fivefold increased odds of smoking among males compared to smoking among females was observed (OR = 4.92; p < .01). More than 64% reported betel quid chewing. Prevalence of alcohol use was 16%, which significantly varied between males (49%) and females (5.1%; OR = 17.71; p < .01). Among tobacco smokers, 64.1% were involved in betel quid use. Among alcohol users, 62.9% were involved in betel quid use and more than 58% were smoking tobacco. Betel quid chewing was the most prevalent substance use.\n\nConclusion: Single and dual substance use of the three commonest types were disproportionately high among this hard-to-reach tribal population in the southern state of India, with some gender variations. Alcohol consumption was relatively low. However, the complex nature of substance use, compounded by inaccessible health services, poses a significant challenge to rethink and to reimagine innovative methods of providing mental health care services, for instance, mobile health clinics."

    "abstract": "Introduction: Poor medical information transfer across healthcare visits and providers poses a potential threat to patient safety. Patient-held health records (PHRs) may be used to facilitate informational continuity, handover communication and patient self-management. However, there are conflicting opinions on the effectiveness of PHRs, other than in maternal and child care. Moreover, the experiences of users of PHRs in low- and middle-income countries are critical in policy decisions but have rarely been researched. \n\nAim: This study aimed to explore similarities and differences in the perspectives of patients, carers and healthcare providers (HCPs) on the current PHRs for diabetes and hypertension in Kerala. \n\nMethods: A qualitative design was used comprising semistructured interviews with patients with diabetes/hypertension (n = 20), carers (n = 15) and HCPs (n = 17) in Kerala, India. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. \n\nResults: Themes generated regarding the experiences with PHRs from each user group were compared and contrasted. The themes that arose were organised under three headings: use of PHRs in everyday practice; the perceived value of PHR and where practice and value conflict. We found that in the use of PHRs in everyday practice, multiple PHRs posed challenges for patients carrying records and for HCPs locating relevant information. Most carers carried all patients' past PHRs, while patients made decisions on which PHR to take along based on the purpose of the healthcare visit. HCPs appreciated having PHRs but documented limited details in them. The perceived value of PHRs by each group for themselves was different. While HCPs placed value on PHRs for enabling better clinical decision-making, preventing errors and patient safety, patients perceived them as transactional tools for diabetes and hypertension medications; carers highlighted their value during emergencies. \n\nConclusion: Our findings suggest that users find a variety of values for PHRs. However, these perceived values are different for each user group, suggesting minimal functioning of PHRs for informational continuity, handover communication and self-management. Patient and Public Involvement Patients and carers were involved during the pilot testing of topic guides, consent and study information sheets. Patients and carers gave their feedback on the materials to ensure clarity and appropriateness within the context."

Although these components remain common, the pace of acquisition of phonological and orthographic processing and reading abilities differ across writing systems. \n\nMethods: This study aimed to understand the developmental pattern of reading and phonological processing, assess their interrelationship and study the predictors of reading ability among 175 children, learning to read Malayalam and attending Grades 1–3. They completed various reading (akshara reading, word and nonword reading) and phonological processing (rhyme recognition, syllable deletion, syllable segmentation, phoneme deletion, phoneme substitution, rapid naming and nonword repetition) tasks. \n\nResults: Grade and reading level-based analysis was performed to collate the results. Results revealed a significant overlap of phonological processing and reading abilities among children in Grades 2 and 3. Reading scores demonstrated a weak-to-moderate significant correlation with the phonological processing tasks. Although skilled readers performed significantly better on all phonological processing tasks, their scores did not reach ceiling. Syllable-level tasks were easier compared to phoneme-level tasks, and they significantly predicted the reading abilities of children. \n\nConclusions: The findings contribute to the existing body of evidence for akshara writing systems, specifically in Malayalam alpha-syllabary. The development of phonological processing and reading in Malayalam extends beyond the third grade, and syllable processing contributed to increased variance in reading accuracy among inexperienced readers."

His deep respect for the tradition of romantic writing in his language illustrates that his modernism contains within it a number of contradictory elements. \n\nPaniker’s modernism also represents a kind of literary cynicism that even as it upholds certain characteristics of modernism, chooses to unearth the paradoxes in the modern mind which are left undocumented by dominant versions of writing. One might say that he is a modernist, a postmodernist, a romanticist, and an anti-romanticist, all at the same time. His prose works would furthermore reveal him to be the formulator of a unique theory of reading that brings together the principles of Indian and western aesthetics in a creative way."

    "abstract": "(edited): \n\nBackground: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is now one of the leading causes of disease-related deaths globally. India has the world’s second largest number of individuals living with diabetes. Lifestyle change has been proven to be an effective means by which to reduce risk of T2DM and a number of “real world” diabetes prevention trials have been undertaken in high income countries. \n\nHowever, systematic efforts to adapt such interventions for T2DM prevention in low- and middle-income countries have been very limited to date. This research-to-action gap is now widely recognised as a major challenge to the prevention and control of diabetes. Reducing the gap is associated with reductions in morbidity and mortality and reduced health care costs. The aim of this article is to describe the adaptation, development, and refinement of diabetes prevention programmes from the USA, Finland, and Australia to Kerala.\n\nResults: The resulting programme, the Kerala Diabetes Prevention Programme (K-DPP), includes four key components: 1) a group-based peer support programme for participants; 2) a peer-leader training and support programme for lay people to lead the groups; 3) resource materials; and 4) strategies to stimulate broader community engagement. The systematic approach to adaptation was underpinned by evidence-based behaviour change techniques.\n\nConclusion: K-DPP is the first well-evaluated community-based, peer-led diabetes prevention programme in India. Future refinement and utilisation of this approach will promote translation of K-DPP to other contexts and population groups within India as well as other low- and middle-income countries. \n\nThis same approach could also be applied more broadly to enable the translation of effective non-communicable disease prevention programmes developed in high-income settings to create context-specific evidence in rapidly developing low- and middle-income countries."

    "abstract": "Benjamin Bailey (1791–1871) was one of the first English-born Church Missionary Society missionaries to go to India. Along with Joseph Fenn and Henry Baker, Sr, he was part of what has been called the Travancore Trio. \n\nTheir objective was to reform the ancient community of Syrian Christians in Travancore so that they in turn might be a great native missionary force in India. Their mission was known as the ‘Mission of Help’ to the ancient Syrian Church. The mission was distinctive from others in India at that time which sought more directly to call for the conversion of the country's massive Hindu and Muslim populations. \n\nThis article will show that Bailey seriously underestimated doctrinal differences between the CMS and the Syrians. Moreover, the place of the Syrians in the complex social fabric of Travancore was not adequately understood. Unlike other missions, this one may almost be said to have as its aim the conversion of an existing church. That call for conversion, however, arose from fundamentally divergent understandings of Christian belief and practice. \n\nThe article concludes by considering further some of the sources of these divergences and engaging with some of the critique that the Mission of Help has received."

    "abstract": "Until the 1960s, Kūṭiyāṭṭam — India’s Sanskrit theatre — was exclusively performed in Hindu temples of Kerala by an ensemble of three ritual performers of high status: the Cākyār actor-master, the Nampyār percussionist, and the Naṅṅyār reciter, cymbalist and actress. \n\nWithin this devotional context, Kūṭiyāṭṭam, whose essence is theatre (nāṭya), is considered an offering of ‘dance’ (nṛtta) to the main divinity. \n\nFurthermore, the performative cycles, lasting from three to forty-one days, incorporate dances known as ‘kriya’, literally ‘what has to be done’ or ‘action’, designating the ritual action here. \n\nThis paper attempts to complement previous studies based on the Indian theory of theatre, by questioning the uses and roles of dance in the Kūṭiyāṭṭam theatrical sphere and tackling the issue of boundaries between dance and dramatic action. \n\nThe study draws on long-range anthropological research as well as on the Kūṭiyāṭṭam literature, especially the Cākyar’s acting and production manuals (āṭṭaprakāram and kramadīpikā) written in Malayalam, three of which are composed for the performance of the following Sanskrit plays: Bālacaritam and Abhiṣekanāṭakam of Bhāsa, and Āścaryacūḍāmaṇi of Śaktibhadra."

    "abstract": "Therapeutic practices of the Indian subcontinent underwent considerable strain after the influence of Western medicine under British colonialism. As a response, the emerging elite within indigenous medicine sought to reposition contemporary medical practices of the late 19th and the 20th centuries within the broad ambit of the classical Sanskrit textual tradition. The modernisation of Ayurveda was possible by establishing medical schools and clinics and standardising drug production following the classical texts. Scholars identify this as ‘revitalisation’, a means of negotiating Indian medical traditions with the challenges posed by Western medicine and thereby crafting a distinct identity for Ayurveda that was capable of meeting the challenges of 20th-century contemporary needs. \n\nI argue that the negotiation between the practitioner and the patient in shaping 20th-century Ayurveda remains an essential element in its transition to modernity. By engaging with the patient files at the Kottakkal Aryavaidyasala, a clinic in Kerala, the chapter engages with the changing world of disease and cure under colonial contexts."

    "abstract": "One day while wearing a burqa, I went to get phone credit in a shop in an upscale market in southern Delhi. The shop assistant thought I was a foreigner and started talking to me in English even before I opened my mouth. Apparently he had thought I was from the Gulf, although I was dressed exactly like the burqa-clad Indian Muslim women. But it was striking to me that it was easier to assume that a woman in a burqa in this dominantly Hindu and upper-class area would definitely be a non-Indian; that it was easier to imagine her as a tourist, but not as a local or a fellow Indian. This obviously meant that the psychological distance was too huge to accommodate a healthy practice of citizenship, especially that the phenomenon of ghettoisation is more evident in Northern India, which, according to an Islamic scholar at Lucknow, appeared after partition as a means to ensure security of the self, belief and livelihood. After Gujarat 2002, citizenship in India was subject to a test. It would be wrong to assume that this incident is a passing irregularity in the stream of events, since only the truth of many things is realised by these fast or spontaneous fragments of happenings. The idea of citizenship after all revolves around the sense of security. Hence, the resulting ghettoisation found in the rest of the country poses substantial threats to a healthy solid formation of citizenship. I ended my fieldwork in India with a short stay in one of these Muslim ghettos in South Mumbai. The words of the Muslim taxi driver that took me to the airport somehow summarises the stories hundreds of interviewees wished to deliver:\n\nThe Muslim area you were staying in is very safe, the Muslims are very united there, no one, except for the police, dares to come and kill, but the other places especially on the outskirts of Mumbai are dangerous and full of problems because of Shiv Sena."

    "abstract": "Iron was a new entrant and a must in weaponry in the 2nd and 1st millennium BCE. There is every possibility of iron being used for generations, and deposited or hidden for use in the times of need or even as a part of religious activities. Dating iron has been mostly based on the associated finds, and iron has been repeatedly melted, shaped, and reused. Differentiating the iron in use at present from that in earlier times has been a challenge and requires the dating of artefacts. Chemical objects characterisation is context-specific.\n\nThree iron objects recovered from a cave near Triprangode (Malappuram District in Kerala) was studied using various analytical techniques to understand the metallurgical characteristics such as microstructure, phases, inclusions, and production technology. The artefact was also dated using accelerator mass spectroscopy (AMS). The three artefacts included two swords and a tripod, which were reported to belong to the 1st millennium BCE based on associated pottery finds and typological comparison. \n\nOptical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy techniques were employed for microstructure analysis. X-ray fluorescence analysis was used to identify the elements present in the samples. X-ray diffraction and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analyses were performed to identify the phases present in the samples. AMS radiocarbon dating was carried out to determine the age of the artefacts. A combination of these techniques helped to identify the iron-making process.\n\nThis study reveals that samples recovered from the rock-cut cave in Triprangode are ferrous materials with low-carbon steel. The presence of slag inclusion in the tripod and its low carbon content indicate the smelting method is in the bloomery iron-making process. This process was in use until the 18th century to produce warfare artefacts.\n\nThe microstructure of the tripod sample contained ferrite and pearlite. The 17th century iron with 1st millennium BCE pottery could be the result of reuse of earlier caves for storing or hiding medieval weapons. \n\nThis signifies the importance of dating the artefact(s) with absolute dating method like AMS, than relying on the accepted dates of associated finds like that of pottery."

    "abstract": "The literature emphasizes institutional formation in the process of a young woman becoming a nun or sees her motivations as stemming from expectations of social and economic mobility. This article focuses on the nun's call as event (Badiou 2001; Humphrey 2008), revealing its truth to the subject and reconstituting her by her fidelity to it. However, its validation and realisation are only accomplished within the structured formation and discipline of congregational life. Through an ethnographic analysis of the lives of nuns in two indigenous Catholic convents in Kerala, South India, the article shows that they often have to struggle against their families to embrace their call. The congregation endorses the authenticity of a young woman?s call while requiring its constant reexamination through prayer and meditation. Thus, a nun's call is encoded in formulaic structures through institutional formation, but its sensory and imaginary experiences are uniquely hers. Analytically distinguishing the calling event from the narrated event, the article integrates a Foucauldian understanding of disciplinary practices with Alain Badiou's idea of the singular event for a grounded ethnographic grasp of the subject formation of a nun within her calling."

Guided by the landscape of choice approach, it proposes that school choice is a complex process through which the parents’ preference for a particular type of school gets transformed into the choice of a specific school, mediated through the specific socio-political-economic context. It highlights the role of persuading and constraining factors in shaping the preference and choice at the household level based on a study conducted in four different villages of the state. It recognises parents as active choosers and calls for a greater role for parents while formulating schooling policies in the local context."

Kerala, despite the presence of civil society in the health sector shows a pattern of ?health divide?, with tribal communities experiencing a higher health burden than non-tribal communities. This becomes problematic in the case of some peculiar diseases, particularly genetic diseases such as Sickle Cell Disease (SCD). The article explores the involvement of civil society in health systems with a special focus on SCD and enquires into links between socio-economic position and health care utilization patterns. The study identifies the existence of inter-community differences in health care utilization across social classes, depicting the fact that even after the involvement of civil society organizations, socio-economic stratifiers still remain an important impediment in uplifting the health status of SCD patients."

    "abstract": "The book relies on extensive and comprehensive police data of all public order events that came to police notice in a city in the state of Kerala in southern India from April 2003 to March 2004. The notes were recorded in the office of the chief of the city police. In total, 2,178 public events of police interest have been analysed.\n\nThe book, an empirical examination of police work in parts of India, focuses on the relationships and dynamics of public events and the police responses. It is an optimistic account, but one aware of minor qualifications. It showcases democratic India and its police force, although apprehensive about the damage of communal violence. Kumar makes a consistent and convincing case that police work can only be understood by the environment in which it takes place.\n\nIt is refreshing to see a police officer with extensive operational, management, and administrative experience and expertise publish in academic circles. This is too little of this in policing literature. Kumar combines his policing career with a strong academic bent. Although a police practitioner, he does at times indicate failings in the nature of public order policing in his home country. He is particularly incisive and insightful of police procedures, processes, and protocols in controlling the complex and vexatious nature of a plethora of public events. The reader is aware that this scholarly book is the product of a senior police officer; the police perspective is apparent but, due to his diligent and methodical research methods, this does not override the work."

    "abstract": "Muslim women of Kerala form a heterogeneous group with its own cultural diversities in the multi cultural and pluralistic society of this state. The religion Islam accords special status to women but in practice the challenges they face when they try to empower themselves and to bring them up within the main stream of social life are double fold when compared to the efforts of their sisters in other communities. Even after 68 years of independence, women in Kerala, in spite of their highest literacy rates and educational achievements, failed to produce strong women political leaders, competent entrepreneurs, ac- claimed social reformers or distinguished personalities of power except a few. But, this cannot be attributed to the dearth of talents; perhaps it maybe due to the attitude of the patriarchic society. Muslim women stand themselves as a separate group within the general population who are destined to fight within the society as well as their own community to come up against the main stream social life. This paper attempts to observe the current status of Muslim women, and the challenges they face on this path"

    "abstract": "Universally, it is accepted that the objective of financial inclusion is to extend the scope of activities of the organized financial system to include within its ambit the people with low incomes. In India, there is a need for coordinated action amongst the banks, the government and related agencies to facilitate access to bank accounts and make satisfaction to the financially excluded. By expanding financial inclusion, inclusive growth can be attained through achieving equity. The policy makers have already initiated some positive measures aimed at expanding financial inclusion. In this situation it is quite relevant to examine the satisfaction level of customers towards Financial Inclusion. The present study has been conducted among the selected Agricultural and Indus- trial Workers in Malappuram District of Kerala. The study concludes that the industrial workers are more satisfied than Agricultural Workers in the area on Financial Inclusion measures."

This paper discusses the social and theoretical issues due to the marginalization of migrant laborers in Kerala. They are denied voting rights in veil of a hidden ‘sons of the soil theory’. Most of the issues pertaining to the domestic migrant laborers in Kerala, and those evolving, are due to the continuing negligence by the authorities and the civil society. Domestic migrants as well as the home society are not considering the current prevailing labor space in Kerala as per- manent. It is high time to learn that the domestic migrant population of the state are similar to the Non Resident Keralites in the Gulf countries, in terms of contributions to the economy and work sector. With regard to the political rights, they must be counted as if the case of Mumbai or Delhi malayalees who never tolerate such a discrimination in their motherland."

    "abstract": "The main feature of microfinance is that it helps the poor to create productive capital and to protect the capital they have to deal with and the risk associated with it. In addition, the expansion of economic opportunities reduces gender disparities among the poor. In Kerala, the system of Microfinance had received a wide spread popularity and acceptance through the Neighbourhood Groups (NHGs) of Kudumbashree. Kudumbashree today acts as a multi faceted women based participatory poverty eradication programme. The core ac- tivity of the programme is women empowerment through microfinance, micro enterprise and convergent community action. The present paper focuses on the effectiveness of Kudumbashree in reducing economic vulnerability of socially disadvantaged women based on empirical observation of the functioning of the programme in three districts of Kerala - Malappuram, Wayanad and Thiruvananthapuram."

However, among all these three mentioned forces, which addressed caste question and contributed to the modernity of Kerala for Communists have some broader vision towards this direction. Unlike rest of India, Dalits in Kerala enjoyed comparative advantage in accessing public spheres. However, emerging trends point towards the shrinking public sphere which makes it difficult for the Dalits to envision their life. The unleashing of market forces, consumerist middle class, and aggressive posture adopted by the religious and communal forces on civil society makes it impossible for the Dalits to access public sphere. Caste inequalities continue to be prevalent in Kerala society in veil. While the ritual rigidity of caste structure is vanishing, [word unclear] realm in the caste identity is getting strong which creates a mockery on the modernity in Kerala."

The WHO has defined the attainment of the highest possible health, ie. Physical, mental and social wellbeing and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity, as a fundamental human right (WHO, 2001). But the disabled people belong to the unprivileged category who always faces discrimination in every walk of life. Among them the disabled women face double discrimination both as women and as disabled. The Government of India along with its various departments provides various rehabilitation programmes and policy interventions for the welfare of the disabled community. An evaluation of these programmes shows that most of them have little effect at the grass root level. So special effective measures are needed at all levels to integrate them to the mainstream of development."

Except a few, most respondents were Syrian Catholics, the community which pioneered settler migration to the regions that later became the migrant settlements.  By migrant settlements the researcher refer to the forest covered or sparsely habited regions in the north, central and south Kerala that became destinations the settler migrants - particularly Syrian Catholics – from Kottayam and adjoining areas since 1920s. The post-resettlement economic order of these External regions is characterized with the limited integration of household economies into the market dynamics and more assimilation into the kinship and neighborhood relations. In a sense, the reciprocal exchange relations have an economy of their own to meet the long term and adboc monetary/ non-monetary needs of a bousehold.  A greater part of the domestic economy was outside the monetary sphere and the social relations were largely isolated from market mechanisms. It is the decline of these exchange relations over time has facilitated the growth of an income outstripping consumption regime throughout the recent times."

It is in this context that minority rights have assumed added significance in the post-independence era. In the Indian constitution there are certain specific provisions regarding minority rights in education. Among all of them the most specific provision is Article 30(1) which says: \"All minorities whether based on religion or language, shall have the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice\". In such circumstances, Article 30 and its promises of minority rights are very much significant in Kerala's education sector where minorities enjoy a dominant position. This paper is an attempt to examine these aspects."

The Cera state was not replaced by another pan-regional state. The succeeding polities were organised, almost invariably, into chiefdoms, localities, and estates, large and small. These were essentially localised nodes of control, operating under several geographical constraints. How did this transition from one form of polity to the other come about?"

It is the innovation of tradition -- of a conservative and at least partly ritualistic art form opening itself to a wide audience and new public spaces. This article gives an example of this dynamic flow.\n\nJatayuvadham (the slaying of Jatayu) is the name given in the Kutiyattam tradition to the Fourth Act of Saktibhadra's play Ascarycudamani. Stage manuals prove that all seven acts of Ascaryacudamani are part of the traditional repertoire. In Kutiyattam, selected acts (not the whole play) are staged."

The article discusses the encounter between matrilineal customs and the Anglo-Muhammadan law in the site of Mappila Muslim matrilineal practices in colonial Malabar, of the Madras Presidency during c. 1910-1928. Young male members of the joint family used the language that matriliny is un-Islamic, and passed laws in the Legislative Assembly to demand that joint family property requires to be inherited in the patrilineal line. Three legislations were passed during the period of 1910-1940 to bring Muslim families in accordance with the ideal notions of familial organization existed in that period. The ideal notions were set up by the precepts of the Anglo-Muhammadan law, the orientalist knowledge of Islam, ideologies of colonial modernity, and dreams of caste and religious reform movements among the people of Malabar, and other neighboring states, Cochin and Travancore. In response to that, there was a re-articulation of customs and familial practices by using legal provisions available in the Islamic law, and an effort for justifying the practices to avoid the ruin of matriliny. Subsequently, the matrilineal Mappilas of Malabar retained matrilineal customs rather intact, though the gender relations and religious practices were re-articulated in the idioms of patriarchy and textuality."

    "abstract": "The paper examines Sufi ship–body symbolism in a painting on the wall of an eighteenth-century mosque from the riverine hinterland of the Malabar coast as well as in two poems, one in Arabic and the other in Arabi-Malayalam, produced in the region. \n\nFocusing on the intricate details of the painting and poems, the paper shows how the ship’s semantic field (sea, storm, pirates, pearls, shore, and so on) is connected to everyday Islamic rituals and mystical ideas and beliefs. \n\nIn discussion, the paper draws attention to the creative hermeneutics of the local Muslim scholars and the use of an imagery which has a deep resonance in the intellectual history of Islam as well as in the littoral–cultural context of Malabar. \n\nThe paper highlights the need to include imageries and motifs from inside the mosque when looking at artistic agency in the mosque architecture of the region. \n\nThe paper argues that the ship painting in the spatiality of the mosque and in the Arabi-Malayalam poems is intended to induce wonderment among its audience, and thereby to inculcate ethical and pietistic dispositions among them."

    "abstract": "Miriam Benteler presents an ethnographically-detailed and historically-informed account of the Catholic practice of god-\nparenthood in the Latin Catholic communities of coastal Kerala. \n\nUsing data from the field to improve on conventional models, she illuminates how a practice of extra-Indian origin, introduced in the early 1500s, particularised itself locally. The roles ordinarily performed by the mother’s brother in patrilineal South Indian societies were gradually assimilated at the same time that the distinction between ‘natural’ parenthood and ‘spiritual’ godparenthood became more blurred. \n\nBenteler demonstrates that the Kerala Catholic practice of godparenthood was both adapted to and altered by South Indian kinship patterns and mores. Christian godparenthood was ‘parochialised’ or ‘reparticularised’. She argues that certain features of local kinship systems (the heightened importance of ‘avunculate’ relationships, for instance) have been extended and taken up into Kerala Catholic life, despite being absent from the Portuguese model originally introduced."

I speak from my own location – that of the ‘post-colony’ – borrowing this term from Niranjana (1998). In her reckoning, ‘post-colony’ refers not only to a position (the ‘postcolonial’) but to a location as well, a difference that definitely marks our political engagement as feminist intellectuals in third-world spaces who strive to not only make feminism comprehensible but also emphasize the dependence of such translation on contingent political and cultural contexts (Niranjana, 1998: 144). Academics in the ‘post-colony’ likewise seek to translate debates that unfold in first-world academic contexts, but their translation is shaped by local political-cultural contexts."

    "abstract": "One day in Kerala, I got the following mobile text message from a Malayalee female student: “An Afghani woman was asked why she felt it necessary to walk five feet behind her husband. She answered: ‘Landmines’.” Although the setting is Afghanistan, the inherent message crosses borders as women caricature the prevalent discourses on backwardness. Both the creator and the sender of the text message apparently intended to resist the ways Muslim women are portrayed. I searched for this joke on the internet trying to locate its origins and, most interestingly, I found an older variation of it. The context was post-Gulf War Kuwait in 1991. In the older joke, a journalist had noticed that, before the war, women used to walk behind their husband; after the war, however, it was the men who walked ten feet behind their wives. When the journalist asked one of the women how they managed to create this change, the woman simply replied, “Landmines”. Just as this joke reflects a paradox in gender roles and how historically there has been an ebb-and-tide-like liberalisation, configuration and misconfiguration of gender roles, this chapter deals with the paradoxes in the lives of Muslim women in Kerala (the female Malayalee). In this chapter, I start by presenting the inherent differences between the political culture and history of Kerala and North India. Then I refer to the characteristics and the paradoxes of the Kerala model, and eventually I highlight the most significant collective actors in shaping the conceptual and contextual frameworks of jihād, citizenship and women’s agency, in which Islam is a clear ingredient of the plot for protest and social change."

    "abstract": "This chapter summarises the demographic transition in Kerala, the impact of the transition on the migration scenario and labour force of the state and implications of such a scenario for the state’s economy. The rate of growth of Kerala’s native population will turn negative within a decade or so. Both mortality and fertility levels have touched near saturation bottom levels, and migration plays a critical role in shaping the future demographic scenario of the state. While as demographic dividend, the working population has significantly bulged in Kerala, unemployment is acute given the high levels of educational attainment and limited employment opportunities within. Known as a remittance economy, migration has been a major factor reducing unemployment within the state. Both international migration and migration to the other states from Kerala have registered downward trends. At the same time, in the labour force, there is an acute shortage of workers to take up the low-skilled, low-valued jobs. As a result, the state has also evolved as a major destination for labourers from other states. The changes in the migration scenario in the state due to demographic transition call for better migration management strategies so that a potential catastrophic impact on the state’s economy can be averted."

The chapter analyses panel data across four migration surveys starting from 1998, where a total of 358 households were covered. It seeks to answer questions on the changes to household type and composition as well as quality of life due to migration. The results show that over the years, household size has shrunk, indicating a preference for nuclear families. Also, the standard of living of return-migrant households has increased over time but shows a decline among emigrant households after 2008 compared to return emigrants. The quality of life of return out-migrants has also considerably decreased. KMS is the only panel-level migration data that exists in India."

    "abstract": "This chapter analyses the intergenerational diaspora engagement of Keralite migrants in Switzerland. In the southern state of India, Kerala, migration has been internalised to such an extent in society that scholars speak of migration as a part of the Keralite culture. Migrants play an important role in the development of their countries of origin. Diaspora engagement has emerged as a significant area of concern for academia and policy making. As migrants maintain social, economic and political transnational ties to their country of origin, they have been identified as important stakeholders for the development in their home country. Although remittances represent a very tangible link within this subject-matter, this chapter goes beyond remittances. Through a comparison of transnationalism within the first and the second generation of the Keralite diaspora in Switzerland, this article aims to figure future diaspora engagement policies. The recognition of the second generation’s double belonging is the breeding ground for effective diaspora engagement policies. However, the diaspora members in Switzerland have indicated political obstacles for an effective diaspora engagement in Kerala. By creating an enabling environment for diaspora engagement, the state of Kerala can harness and allocate the resources of its diaspora in a more effective way."

It argues that the Putnamian framework of bonding capital is often insufficient to understand migrant group bonding ties and notes that unequally distributed economic and (Swedish) cultural capital within the migrant group is a more reliable determinant of intragroup bonding capital than ethnicity and can even regulate bridging capital within the host society. Additionally, the chapter suggests that it is important to place a migrant group’s patterns of inclusion and exclusion within the wider social context within which it is situated."

The development experience of Kerala, particularly the discussions on the ‘Kerala model of development’ and ‘virtuous growth’, sets the background for the study. \n\nThe book uses evidence collected from Malappuram district (with the largest number of international migrants in the state) and highlights the importance of diverse geography, migration pattern, cultural composition, and history of development in understanding the way each region follows the larger model.\n\nInstead of developing regional human development indices, the focus has been on specific capabilities in different local economies. Jafar argues that specific locales need to be accounted for in the larger narratives of development in any region. \n\nThe findings show that geographic diversity, culture, migration, gender, and education affect the instrumental and constitutive freedom derived from specific capabilities. \n\nThe book also tries to present Malappuram’s experience as a snapshot of the lower-end case of education-led development in Kerala and offer some interesting insights on the relationship between education and development."

In this regard, the article explores the political and social economy of care and examines the nature and conditions of migrant women’s work in the context of two particular care sectors, namely the domestic care work and healthcare sectors (nurses as professionals). It also explores how gender roles and relations are reinforced and how the notion of masculinity and patriarchalism is reconstructed due to women’s increased participation in care industries and service sectors. It presents an overview of emigration from Kerala to Gulf regions and its gender dimensions and describes the recent trends and emerging issues. It also addresses the implications of state policy and social norms on emigration of Keralite women workers and explores issues behind the migratory experiences of women migrant domestic workers and nurses."

It was also established that even if households in the state consisted of men left behind, the proportion was incomparably lower than that of women left behind. Remittances were sent to women left behind in the state, making them the only decision maker or an important part in the decision-making process."

    "abstract": "The southwest coast of India has always been a significant site within the global network of relations through trade and exchange of ideas, commodities, technologies, skills and labour. The much longer history of colonial experience makes Kerala’s engagement with modernity polyvalent and complex. Without understanding the multiple space-times of this region, it is impossible to make sense of the complexities of Kerala modernity beyond its general description as ‘Malayalee modernity’.\n\nFrom the colonial pepper trade and Narayana Guru’s philosophical engagement with the question of caste to the seemingly disparate elements that weave together an ‘eclectic past’  through the Muziris Heritage Project; from the debates on women’s sexuality around the Suryanelli rape case to the gendered constitution of public space during the mass annual Attukal Pongala ritual; from the changes in state attitude towards providing piped water supply to how Cochin port’s inter-War history has scripted urban modernity; from the shaping of the public sphere to the radical Left politics of the 1970s and the emergence of popular janapriya literature—this book analyses the ideas, spaces and practices that intricately weave the region’s experiences of modernity.\n\nKerala Modernity emphasises the methodological need to re-examine the idea of ‘region’ as a discursive category to explore Kerala’s regional modernity apart from Eurocentric and nation-centric frames of analyses. The interdisciplinary presentation, complete with a Dalit critique of modernity in the Foreword, will be an important contribution to literature on Kerala and the debates on alternative modernities in South Asia. It will be of interest to students and scholars of history, sociology and literary and cultural studies, as well as the interested general reader."

    "abstract": "The chapter explores the new aesthetic phenomenon of reading in connection with two issues involved in the formation of 'the popular' in the literary history of Malayalam prose.\n\nIt first discusses the courses of informed criticism in which a style named 'janapriyam' or 'painkili' was qualified as an 'anti-ideal' vis-a-vis the ideal (canonical) literary craft in modern Malayalam literature.\n\nIt then analyses two of the low-priced romantic janapriya novels (Padatha Painkili; Mariyakutty) by Muttathu Varkey, a pioneer of the genre in Malayalam."

While the stories were about ordinary people, often amusing and sometimes sombre, they also dealt with the underlying issues of identity in the North East.In The View from Kollam, Balagopal continues to regale us with his skills as a raconteur, with his ability to see a story even in the most mundane occurrences in a small district office. He recounts stories that dwell on the events that defined his work as a district official in Kollam, Kerala, in the early 1980s. Amid the rough and tumble of daily work, there are engrossing tales that illustrate the skill, dexterity and sincerity that a district official needs to overcome hurdles and keep the administration moving.What shines through in this worm’s-eye view of administration is Balagopal’s earnest belief that given the space for original thought and action, it is the district that holds the key to improving governance in a large and diverse country like India."

    "abstract": "Malayalam cinema's constructs of femininity offer interesting insights into economies of gender in contemporary Kerala. Female self-fashioning in films has overwhelmingly centred around valorising a normative femininity, defined here as a femininity that privileges motherhood and the moral upbringing of the Malayalee nation through a moral submission to patriarchy. Agential roles for female protagonists are rare; the convention is to \"punish\" within the narrative female refusal of normative femininity. Three films, Trivandrum Lodge (2012), Gaddama (2011) and 22 Female Kottayam (2012), are read as challenging this edging out of the \"woman question\" through their naturalisation of female protagonists' habitation of spheres other than the private/domestic. In the process they question the normalisation of discourses of reproductiveheteronormativity and nationalist purity through women."

    "abstract": "The film industry in Kerala (popularly known as ‘Mollywood’ in the mediasphere) is an obvious example of the changing face of the regional film industries in India in accordance with the varying socio-cultural values and demands of the audience. These films claim a multifaceted ‘newness’ in their narration, ranging from the themes explored to their techniques of production and narration. This article seeks to analyze whether this ‘newness’ is contemplated in the conceptualization of female characters within films. We conclude that although women are conceptualized as part of a globalized culture in which ‘she’ has an identity, they are nevertheless subject to the familiar gender hierarchy and marginalized identity."

    "abstract": "This article explores the Islamic home-film movement in Kerala, India, a video film movement by amateur filmmakers of the Muslim Community. These films circulate in VCD and DVD format in retail outlets in both Kerala and the Gulf Council Countries (GCC). These films are important for their supporting group, Jamaat-e-islami, one of the most powerful Islamist groups in the South Asian countries of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, as they try to gain hegemony among Kerala’s Sunni Muslims through an alternative Islamic public culture. Home-films now circulate beyond their original audience of Muslim women in Kerala, among Keralite migrants in the Arab Gulf, who organize public screenings in social gatherings and labour camps. Indeed, the large-scale migration of labor to the GCC has led to a re-imagination of the moral geography of Kerala Muslim households to account for changing gender norms and family structures. The films, concerned with social reform among the Muslim Community of Kerala, also refract the experience of migration to the GCC, particularly in narrating an emotional landscape characterized by precarious conditions of labour, racialised hierarchy and the kafala (the specific employment system in many GCCs, that is a combination of a contract and patronage) through specific tropes of precarity and philosophy of risk in these films."

Progressive film makers of the 1960s attempted to address the theme of subaltern and dared to give the subaltern a voice, but they remained singular attempts. Through a case study on a Malayalam film, <i>Papilio Buddha</i>, this article tries to analyze the representation of Dalit community in Indian cinema.\n\nThough Malayalam film industry has tried to address the concern of Dalits, they have been stereotyped in many ways and reduced to being sidekicks to villains or unskilled labourers having no identity. They remained as instruments to idolize the hero, to act as a contrast to the elite protagonist or as the poor helpless victims who offer the protagonist an opportunity to display his heroism.\n\n<i>Papilio Buddha</i> grabbed media attention when it was denied clearance by the censor board as it explores the territory of Dalit consciousness by focusing the lens on the land strike by the Dalit communities and creating a counter narrative to the hitherto idealized images created by the state."

    "abstract": "The “region”--understood in terms of the linguistically organized states--has been one of the central categories around which debates about cultural politics in India have been organized in the last two decades. \n\nThis article argues that within this scholarship, the “region” has figured as a mirror of the nation, either as continuing from the impulses of the nation or as a response to it. Contra this, it proposes that “region” should be understood as being formed simultaneously within and without the structuring of the nation.\n\nEven while the horizon of universality provided by the nation to its subjects presents the figure of the “citizen” as its teleology, nonnational resources are mobilized to configure the subject of the region.\n\nRather than a historical development, this performative subject, who works with multiple horizons of universality, is foundational to the formation of the region.\n\nThis article, using two Malayalam language films from the South Indian state of Kerala, <i>Arabikatha</i> (Arabian Tale) and <i>16 MM: Memories, Movement and a Machine</i>, attempts to think through how mistranslation of the “world” is central to the formation of the regional subject."

    "abstract": "This paper examines the spectral nature of the genre of Malayalam soft-porn that emerged in the late 1980s but has now disappeared with rapid changes in the industry.\n\nI argue that the memory of soft-porn bleeds into the present, as if in an attempt to negotiate retroactively with the end of the celluloid era and to recoup the memory of the form that has been pronounced dead and gone by the end of 2000s.\n\nBy examining the modes through which cinematic memory carries the charge of the immanent past into the contemporary moment both in terms of narrative strategies and the physical space of the cinema, I look at S.P. Theater in Trivandrum, the film Kanyaka Talkies and the installation Kuliyum Mattu Scenukalum by Priyaranjan Lal, all of which reflect the form of soft-porn as remnants of the past that haunt the present in significant ways.\n\nS.P. Theater, located in the outskirts of the city of Trivandrum, insistently maintained its status as a popular destination for soft-porn aficionados even after the form had fizzled out in the industry.\n\nOn the other hand, the film Kanyaka Talkies traces the life of a fictional soft-porn theater that was converted to a Church. One of the crucial moments in the film features the installations that would later become part of Lal’s Kuliyum Mattu Scenukalum to reflect the inner contradictions in the built space of the Church/Theater.\n\nBetween the fictional rendering of the soft-porn theater in the film, and its “real” variant in the form of S.P. Theater, I argue that the current cinema-scape is marked by a lingering ghostly presence of a recently deceased film form."

P. Ramadas, 1955) and Rarichan enna powran (Citizen Rarichan, dir. P. Bhaskaran, 1956)—as cinematic experiments in conceiving the urban space from two influential ideological positions, and as attempts in adapting to modernist idioms of international cinema. \n\nModalities of imagining the urban space, the author argues, attained crucial historical significance in aesthetics and politics: it enabled the cultural producers to aesthetically situate the films within global cultures of cinema, thus invoking and molding the contemplative viewer; politically, these films mark the earliest attempts to conceive the region's relation to modernity through the grids of imagining the urban."

Rajeev Ravi, 2013)—attempts to account for a moment in the history of Malayalam cinema when an attempt to spatially imagine, through iterative images, the city as a visible space that was distinct, and situated within the state of Kerala, was undertaken. \n\nThe “city” in Malayalam cinema is at once mediated by a history of its engagement with aesthetics and economics, as well as the modes with which precolonial, colonial, and postcolonial histories are spatially and temporally arranged. \n\nThe article attempts to think of the city in Malayalam cinema as a moment of refiguration of its history and practices. The city as location in Malayalam cinema emerges as a negotiation with a specific form of realism anchored in rural anthropology put together in what has been termed the “middlebrow cinema” of the 1980s."

This paper looks into the modes through which a sportsman is produced in relation to notions of authenticity and love for football in Kerala.\n\nI attempt to analyse the vernacular literature and field narrations on a sportsman known as Olympian Rahman, who is one of the most iconic and popular figures of sport in Kerala. \n\nI explore the meanings of Olympian Rahman's ‘authentic' love for football within regional notions prevalent in Kerala, which posit authentic love as opposed to not only ‘ordinary' engagements with football but also as in conflict with official, national, and international football bodies. \n\nThis form of love for football is understood as interior to a person and is identified through a performance of sincerity and emotions in public. \n\nIn conclusion, I argue that the life narrations of Olympian Rahman are inevitably a quest for an authenticity, which resists the universalisation of football experience through an adherence to love."

Cherian discusses his work as an independent filmmaker in India and the US, his artistic and political commitment, and the challenges he has faced with the Central Board of Film Certification in India after the release of his first feature film Papilio Buddha (2013), which focuses on Dalit land struggles in Kerala, and again with his second feature film KaBodyscapes (2016).\n\nThe interview explores how holding a dual status as an American citizen and an Overseas Citizen of India makes his situation more complex because it offers him both the freedom and constraints of being a permanent outsider. The discussion of Papilio Buddha and its representation of the Dalit land struggle is the focus of the interview. He also speaks about his intended audience(s) and the way he works on location with his crews. Since Cherian is a poet and a writer as well as a filmmaker, he explains his choices for specific media, in the particular contexts in which he positions himself."

    "abstract": "In the late 1850s, Frances Collins, the wife of a CMS (Church Missionary Society) missionary to Travancore, wrote a novel entitled ‘The Slayer Slain’. It is considered one of the earliest novels to be written in Travancore and has often been referred to in the context of discussions on how colonial modernity came to be constituted in the region in the nineteenth and early twentieth century. This paper explores what it must have meant for women missionaries to write novels within a gendered missionary literary space, and in the specific context of ‘The Slayer Slain’, how the novel became a means through which the author contributed to the debate among missionaries on whether the conversion of the soul would happen from above or from below. The paper also shows how through the characters in the novel, the author constructed models of what an ideal protestant labourer and woman ought to be, which on the one hand was of an emancipated slave and an independent woman, while on the other hand, of a docile labourer and a domesticated wife."

    "abstract": "Why did autobiographical writings emerge in Kerala more than a century ago? What were the social, material and cultural features that motivated individuals to write personal histories and memoirs?\n\nThis book shows the complex ways in which private recollections and the use of memory for loosely literary ends, also entailed the production of history by another name. Udaya Kumar analyses this period of social transformation to show the emergence of new resources for the self-relective writer, as well as of new idioms of expression. \n\nAmong the many genres and forms he studies are anti-caste writings, works advocating spiritual and social reorientation, monologic poetry and early novels in Malayalam. Sree Narayana Guru’s thought, the portrayal of women and desire in Kumaran Asan’s poetry and the fictional worlds created by major novelists of this period (such as O. Chandu Menon and C. V. Raman Pillai), says Udaya Kumar, excited fresh appraisals of morality, personal emotions and shared pasts. \n\nThe envisioning of caste reform, the recording of historical change and the creation of political identities, he shows are often inextricable aspects of new literary practices. Using Kerala’s cultural history as his entry point, Udaya Kumar has written an uncommonly inspirational book of ideas about the relationship of literature to history, on literature as—in a sense—‘history in person’."

    "abstract": "In this essay I argue that Arundhati Roy’s Booker Prize winning novel, The God of Small Things, is deeply inﬂuenced by other southern Indian narratives of caste-based atrocity to be found in popular traditions as well as by South Asian rasa aesthetics, with its crucial concept of lila or play. \n\nBy reading the novel alongside two examples of southern Indian caste atrocity narratives, and by highlighting its use of lila, I contribute some much needed scholarship on caste-based trauma in the Indian subcontinent; I work to broaden (a still western-centric) trauma theory for the postcolonial context; and, just as importantly, I seek to draw scholarly attention to a different way of thinking through recovery or recuperation from trauma. \n\nRoy’s novel, I argue, suggests the possibility that those traumatized by caste-based violence might return repetitively to a traumatic past, not in helpless, terriﬁed ﬂashback, but in a group performance that is a social enactment of a different future, a communal world-making that resists the dominant structures of caste-based hierarchy."

S. Madhavan, he interrogates some basic distinctions of classical narratology, such as that between object and character, and examines postcolonial theorization of memory and location. \n\nThe novel effects a breaking off of both narration and remembrance from the interiority of character, thus thwarting postcolonial allegory since postcolonial memory itself exceeds the individual. \n\nKumar proposes that narrative permits a \"delectation of memory\" that other discourses do not, and Madhavan achieves this, not through conventional methods of focalization, but through narrative abduction of other forms and genres like litany, natakam, poetry (both European and South Asian), and conversation."

    "abstract": "This chapter demonstrates that literary and visual forms from Kerala, that meld together psychological realism, romance, and fantasy, provide a rich site to analyse the crisis-ridden process of the making of the modern subject. \n\nThe chapter explores how literary and filmic forms of excess produce narrative and cinematic worlds that disturb the foundational architecture of the reproductive family and contained models of masculinity and femininity. The texts I focus on are populated by uncanny bodies that slip out of the paradigms of the ‘human’. \n\nMoving away from the dominant framework of Kerala as a ‘progressive’ region invested in science, rationality, and the corresponding narrative form of realism, I speculate on how and why sensational and fantastic texts become the feverish bedrock of Kerala’s modernity. \n\nThe chapter opens with a reading of a short story by Kamala Surayya titled Stree (Woman 1947), followed by a detailed analysis of Malayattoor Ramakrishnan’s novel Yakshi (1967). \n\nThe latter part of the chapter will also briefly engage with two films based on Malayattoor’s novel—Yakshi (1968, directed by K. S. Sethumadhavan) and Akam (Inside, 2013, directed by Shalini Usha Nair). \n\nI argue that these enchanting and thrilling forms of regional cultural production produce a field where the tensions and anxieties regarding the dichotomy between masculinity and femininity, the rational and the affective are played out. \n\nThese texts have a significant place in literary and cinematic history because they capture the persistent disjuncture in modernity’s project of domesticating bodies and desires."

The “Epidemiology of Non-communicable Diseases in Rural Areas” (ENDIRA) study was conducted via ASHAs (Accredited Social Health Activists).\n\nStandardised questionnaires were used in household interviews of individuals ≥ 18 years during 2012 to gather sociodemographic, lifestyle and medical data for this population. The association between below poverty line (BPL) status, NCDs and risk factors was analysed in multivariable regression models. 84,456 adults were included in the analyses (25.4% below the poverty line). In rural Kerala, BPL status was associated with stroke and respiratory diseases, but not with myocardial infarction and cancer although it was associated with smoking status, compared with above poverty line status."

    "abstract": "This study aims to determine trends in the annual and seasonal total rainfall over Bharathapuzha catchment of Kerala using 33 years (1976–2008) of monthly rainfall data at four raingauge stations (Eruthempathy, Mangalam dam, Thrithala, and Malampuzha dam). The procedure is based on the nonparametric Mann–Kendall test for the trend and the nonparametric Sen’s method for the magnitude of the trend. From Mann–Kendall analysis for annual rainfall and southwest monsoon rainfall, a positive trend was observed for Eruthempathy and Malampuza dam stations. However, at all four stations considered, a negative trend was observed for the northeast monsoon rainfall, positive trend for nonmonsoon rainfall and premonsoon except at Eruthempathy. From Sen’s analysis, it was observed for an annual rainfall series a maximum increase of rainfall at Malampuza dam by 1.55 mm/year and a maximum reduction at Thrithala station by −5.80 mm/year. For southwest monsoon, a maximum increase of 2.09 mm/year at Eruthempathy station, and a maximum reduction of −9.81 mm/year observed at Thrithala station. On the other hand, a maximum reduction of −2.63 mm/year observed at Mangalam Dam station for northeast monsoon. For nonmonsoon, a maximum increase of 0.85 mm/year observed at Malampuza Dam and 2.20 mm/year at Thrithala. A similar trend observed from liner regression analysis, existed for annual and seasonal rainfall series estimated by Mann–Kendall Z statistics and Sen’s Slope method. Overall trend analysis for annual rainfall reveals stations in the north and east shows an increasing trend and stations in the south and west a decreasing trend. Current study will direct the future planning and management of water resources at Bharathapuzha river basin."

    "abstract": "Built in the late 1800s, the Mullaperiyar dam in Kerala was meant to divert the waters of the Periyar River to the arid areas of Madurai in what is now Tamil Nadu, following a 999-year lease with the British government. Today, though, the engineering marvel has turned into a bone of contention between two states, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, over Tamil Nadu s insistence to increase the dam s height and Kerala s concerns regarding safety. This dispute has led to widespread riots and protests in both the states. In May 2014, the Supreme Court ruled in favour of Tamil Nadu, but the protests and apprehensions regarding a possible dam burst continue.\n\nThe book, a timely, insightful exploration of the dispute, examines all aspects of the burning issue of livelihood versus safety. Using meticulous research as well as interviews with government officials, technical experts, police personnel and the common people of both states, at times risking his safety, the author brings out the points of view of both sides. He also shows how water wars will become a major issue not just between states, but between countries, in times to come. This book is a must-read to understand the importance of resolving a simmering issue which might explode in the near future."

    "abstract": "Mercury, a global pollutant, is popping up in places where it was never expected before, and it burdens in sediments and other non-biological materials. It is estimated to have increased up to five times the pre-human level due to anthropogenic activities. Vembanad backwaters, one of the largest Ramsar sites in India, which has extraordinary importance for its hydrological function, is now considered one of the mercury hot spots in India. In this study, surface sediment samples of Vembanad Lake and nearshore areas were seasonally analysed for total mercury and methyl mercury concentrations while the core sediment samples were analysed for total mercury. The results showed that the northern part of the lake was more contaminated with mercury than the southern part. The mercury concentration was relatively high in the subsurface sediment samples, indicating the possibility of historic industrial mercury deposition. A decreasing trend in the mercury level towards the surface in the core sediment was also observed. The geochemical parameters were also analysed to understand the sediment mercury chemistry. Anoxic conditions, pH and organic carbon, sulphur and Fe determined the presence of various species of mercury in the sediments of Vembanad Lake. The prevailing physical and geochemical conditions in Vembanad Lake have indicated the chances of chemical transformation of mercury and the potential hazard if the deposited mercury fractions are remobilised."

    "abstract": "Excessive exploitation of and skewed access to dwindling water resources raise serious water justice concerns. Environmental justice movements and related literature have raised critical questions regarding the unequal distribution of the costs and benefits of a development paradigm that is founded on excessive exploitation and appropriation of natural resources. This paper explores the growing relevance of a water justice framework that addresses both the social and ecological aspects of water use and appropriation, with reference to a four-decade long water conflict over the Chaliyar River in Kerala, South India. It highlights how ecosystem degradation and denial of justice go hand in hand. The paper argues that the framing and articulation of the conflict in a partisan manner led to the glossing over of certain critical features, thus preventing a full view of water injustices. It also failed to inform subsequent policies and practices in this regard."

In this paper, the land use/ land cover map of sub watershed of Periyar River processed from Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) satellite is created to understand the spatial distribution of built –up area and to detect the expansion of built up area in the peri-urban areas of Cochin. The Satellite imagery of IRS –1C LISS – III dated 7th February 1995 and IRS –P6 LISS – III dated 13th February 2005 were imported in ERDAS Imagine to create LU/LC map using Maximum Likelihood Method of supervised classification. A total of ten classes broadly including forest, plantation, grassland, barren land and built-up were classified. The forest cover factor was computed in ArcGIS, which is used as a parameter for runoff calculation to assess the contribution of land cover on runoff modelling. A 6% increase in built –up is detected comparing the LU/ LC map indicating that it is undergoing rapid development. The forest cover factor has a slight difference from 0.57 to 0.62 indicating that barren and grassland are been primarily converted to built-up area. The LU/LC map can be used as a preliminary indicator of man-made induced impervious surface. The areal extent of satellite image provides a means for effective planning in future."

    "abstract": "Physical responses of the coastal zones in the vicinity of Cochin, due to sea-level rise are investigated based on analysis of inundation scenarios. Quantification of potential habitat loss was made by merging the Land use/Land cover (LU/LC) prepared from the satellite imagery with the digital elevation model. Scenarios were generated for two different rates of sea-level rise and responses of changes occurred were made to ascertain the vulnerability and loss in extent. LU/LC classes overlaid on 1 m and 2 m elevation showed that it was mostly covered by vegetation areas followed by water and urban zones. For the sea-level rise scenarios of 1 m and 2 m, the total inundation zones were estimated to be 169.11 km2 and 598.83 km2 respectively using Geographic Information System. The losses of urban areas were estimated at 43 km2 and 187 km2 for the 1 m and 2 m sea level rise respectively, which is alarming information for the most densely populated state of India. Quantitative comparison of other LU/LC classes showed significant changes under each of the inundation scenarios. The results obtained conclusively point that sea-level rise scenarios will bring profound effects on the land use and land cover classes as well as on coastal landforms in the study region. Coastal inundation would leave ocean front and inland properties vulnerable. Increase in these water levels would alter the coastal drainage gradients. Reduction in these gradients would increase flooding attributable to rainstorms which could promote salt water intrusion into coastal aquifers and force water tables to rise. Changes in the coastal landforms associated with inundation generate concern in the background that the coastal region may continue to remain vulnerable in the coming decades due to population growth and development pressures."

    "abstract": "For efficient use of water, there is a dire need to manage acute water scarcity in agriculture through the adoption of sustainable water management technologies. To produce more crops per drop of water, the System of Rice Intensification (SRI) technology is being promoted. We undertook a case study in the state of Kerala, India, to examine the factors influencing adoption and dis-adoption of SRI. The humid and tropical climate of Kerala is conducive for rice cultivation. However, over the years, the area under rice cultivation in Kerala has been declining. In this context, SRI technology has emerged as a prominent tool to achieve increased rice production and thus productivity. \n\nThe study reveals that factors such as experience in farming, income from off-farm and non-farm sources, size of landholding and contact with agriculture extension officers are significant determinants of adoption of SRI technology. On the other hand, factors such as difficulty in water management and early transplantation, non-availability of skilled labour and difficulty in using the cono weeder cause the dis-adoption of SRI. We suggest that, in addition to promoting SRI technology, it is also imperative to develop effective irrigation facilities and promote participatory irrigation management to produce more crop per drop of water. Many farmers who discontinued SRI technology cited the lack of institutional support and capacity building as the factors influencing their decision. Therefore, the state government needs to focus on these aspects so that not only dis-adoption can be minimized significantly, but more farmers can also be encouraged to adopt the technology in the coming years."

The forest cover in 2012 was estimated as 2613.4 sq. km (52.1%).\n\nRecently, due to the implementation of policies and protection efforts, the rate of deforestation was greatly reduced. The commencement of hydroelectric projects during 1925–1990 was responsible for an increase of area under water bodies by inundating other land uses. \n\nLong term analysis shows that agricultural area has been decreasing, and area under commercial plantations has been increasing in the district. There has been a significant increase in the area of plantations from 1236.2 sq. km (1975) to 1317.3 sq. km (2012)."

    "abstract": "The present study explains how the state engages with the dominant groups in the community and how people’s consent is manufactured to legitimise the implementation of a project. \n\nOn the basis of focus group discussion with beneficiaries and informal interviews of implementing actors, the study shows that people’s responses towards ‘Jalanidhi’ vary as per their socio-economic position in the society. \n\nWhile the middle and the upper class people generally favoured the project, the poor and weaker sections strongly opposed the idea of user charge for drinking water. \n\nThe middle class viewed the user charge as ‘normal’ and more efficient compared to the state-driven supply. The lower class, especially those who belonged to the Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST), viewed it as a violation of their rights. Yet, they were denied any alternative to the neoliberal agenda of community-based drinking water supply and were forced to conform to the project. \n\nThe study uses insights developed by Michel Foucault, whose genealogical analysis offers tools to understand forms of power relations at the grassroots. \n\nThe study uses ‘Jalanidhi’ as a context to examine these concepts and shows how it can be used to understand the processes that lead to the social acceptance of commodification of natural resources like water."

It is highly essential to identify the prominent changes responsible for its occurrence so that suitable measures can be adopted. \n\nAn attempt was made to identify the prominent land use and land cover changes responsible for the spread of chikungunya, malaria, and dengue fever in the State of Kerala, India, using hierarchical cluster analysis and multiple regression analysis. \n\nLarge extent of water bodies, low land, and agricultural land played a significant role on the incidence of chikungunya and malaria. High population density, built-up area, and agricultural area favoured dengue fever. Vector-borne diseases were found to be the lowest in places where there is no low land and with higher forest area. \n\nInappropriate disposal of wastes generated in the built-up area might be the reason for the spread of dengue fever. Freshwater in drains of these areas is polluted and form breeding grounds for mosquitoes. \n\nHence much attention is to be paid to provide appropriate treatment and disposal of wastes generated in the built-up area of the State. In an evolving urban policy, priority is to be given to the installation of safe treatment and disposal facility of wastes, especially, sewage, sullage, and solid waste. \n\nThe protection of forest land also plays an important role. Economic policy instruments, such as Payment for Environment Services (PES) schemes, may constitute a useful tool to encourage an improved land use management through appropriate price signals, such as, for instance, for the preservation of forested areas, especially in proximity of highly populated urban environments."

It allows the reader to visualise the ‘slow violence’ of fissured earth narratives, such as the stories of toxic buildup, water pollution, deforestation, accelerated species loss, and loss of habitats.\n\nThe connection between rootedness in the local and a sense of belonging to the global ecosystem is best understood through life narratives like Mayilamma, a story that translates the mantra of ecology—everything is connected—into a web of concrete relations that includes not only the ecological, but also cultural, economic, and political processes. \n\nThis is a must read for students of environmental studies, ecological activists, and everyone who feels responsible for their only home—the earth."

During 2000–2011, in situ urbanization process has strengthened this popular belief. \n\nThis trend is more pronounced in the states of Kerala and West Bengal, perhaps due to the colossal escalation of new Census Towns (CTs). The present study is an endeavour to understand whether recent upsurge of urbanization among Muslims in India can be linked with “development” in these two states based on availabilities of Basic Urban Infrastructures (BUIs), principally in the new CTs. \n\nThis has been done by employing an “availability index” of infrastructures by obtaining data from Village Directory of West Bengal and Kerala, Census of India. The BUIs include educational and health institutions, bus and railway services and drinking water facility. \n\nMost importantly, where these amenities were absent in 2001, the distance travelled by the inhabitants, to get access to these services has also been examined here. The study concludes through extending the debate on whether an increase in the number of population, particularly of Muslim community, in urban areas can be taken as a true signature of development or not."

    "abstract": "Responding to agrarian crisis at home, cash crop cultivators hailing from the South Indian district of Wayanad increasingly engage in the seasonal production of ginger in other states of India. This is a purely profit-based and unsustainable crop boom that takes a toll on both labor and the environment. This ethnographic analysis of speculative ginger cultivation situates this emerging economic complex in the regional political ecology, farming practices, individual farmers' hopes and aspirations, and in relation to the qualities of ginger as a cultivar. It argues that ginger is a special kind of boom crop and that its cultivation on large tracts of leased land is the manifestation of a moment of agrarian uncertainty and the neoliberalization of agriculture in South India coproduced by the properties of ginger. As a neoliberal boom crop, ginger exemplifies a regime of flexibilization of agrarian accumulation that has proved a profitable move for some, but has brought financial ruin and debt traps for many others."

    "abstract": "This paper argues that Indian farmers’ suicides may fruitfully be described as public deaths. Based on ethnographic fieldwork in the South Indian district of Wayanad (Kerala), it shows that farmers’ suicides become ‘public deaths’ only via the enumerative and statistical practices of the Indian state and their scandalization in the media. The political nature of suicide as public death thus depends entirely on suicide rates and their production by the state itself. But the power of representations complicates the ethnographic critique of statistical knowledge about suicide. In a context like Wayanad, which had been declared a suicide-prone district by the Indian state, public representations of suicides have taken on a life of their own; statistical categories and the media interpretations of these statistics have had a curious feedback—mediated by development encounters—onto the situated meanings of individual suicides. Local interpretations of individual suicides mostly commented on personal failures of the suicide and on the perils of speculative smallholder agriculture. Ethnography of farmers’ suicide based on case studies alone, however, would soon encounter limitations equally grave as the limitations of statistical analysis. Not only is the meaning of suicide (intentions, causes, motives) at the actor level off limits for ethnography, but in addition to that the (public) meaning of suicide is co-determined by state practice including statistical accounting."

    "abstract": "This paper analyzes the unfolding of a protest in the form of a night-vigil in India in which bodies and acts are rendered sensational through the workings of media technologies. This paper moves away from a national frame and demonstrates that the regional can open up new ways to conceptualize the body and the affective formations of the public. It explores the key question of the public and the political as they are formed in the interstices of visual regimes. By drawing on a wide range of vernacular print and visual culture materials, it analyzes the manner in which bodies and acts caught in the mesh of visual technologies complicate one of the central conceptions of feminism: visibility as intertwined with claiming agency in the public sphere. The intersections of caste, gender, and organized party politics in the sensory regimes of the night-vigil gesture toward the precariousness of publics not as a threat but as a productive possibility. It puts forward the conception of the body as a porous and unstable site and allows for an engagement with scenography of protests in which resistance and embodiment is imagined anew."

    "abstract": "The present is a peculiar time for feminists in India. On the one hand, debates of over two decades now make us sharply aware of vital importance of the intersecting multiple axes of power in shaping patriarchy and hence of the need to acknowledge mutual differences and inequalities. On the other, the high-tide of Hindutva nationalistic jingoism sweeps us all together as ‘anti-nationalist’, as equally dangerous to the Hindutvavaadi nation. Not surprisingly then, in no other time has the need to rethink and rebuild feminist solidarities felt so urgent. The question would perhaps be to ask how we could deploy the insights about the end of ‘romantic sisterhood’ to produce a thorough critique of feminist practice. I contend that for this to happen, intersectional analysis needs to be applied as a tool of feminist self-transformation, acknowledged as integral to lived feminist ethics, and not merely something that figures in the knowledge that we produce. This essay is an attempt to think aloud this challenge and what it entails, from Kerala, a society where feminism is irrevocably pluralized at present, but where feminists do face the Hindutvavaadi threat of exclusion as ‘immoral’ and ‘anti-national’. I propose a new mode of engagement, feminist maitri which may give rise to what Eve Sedgewick has called ‘non-paranoid’ readings alongside the necessary readings of the ills that hamper trust-building in the field of feminist politics – bringing hopefully a delicate balance."

The article uses narrative approach to illustrate the lived experiences of the home-based workers. The evidence from the field study in Kollam district reveals that the majority of the workers engaged in the home-based processing, voluntarily or involuntarily, are women. The home-based processing is considered as an additional option to earn income by these workers. As a result, despite the ban on cottage processing of cashew, it is operating in a clandestine manner. The study shows that the enhancement of individual and collective capabilities of the women in the informal sector requires an understanding of their multiple identities, as well as an acknowledgement of the existing gender relations and social structure."

I argue that Kerala displays as a dominant trend, a non-antagonistic form of communalism or peaceful competition among religious communities, which is a rarity for the Indian subcontinent. \n\nThe reasons for this can be attributed to the severity of caste oppression and the consequent salience of caste divisions, deep inter-religious civic engagement, governmental participation by communal parties, and the presence of a communist movement and the strength of class politics. \n\nHowever, the emergence of Hindu nationalism as a powerful force in India and its capture of state power, and the rise of Islamist extremism, largely as a response to it, have led to a new conjuncture of antagonistic assertion of religious identities. Kerala is not immune to these trends. \n\nThe transformation in political economy and the de-radicalization of the communist movement have provided a conducive atmosphere to them. Yet, non-antagonistic communalism prevails, but less emphatically."

By discussing issues pertaining to the fields of both performance anthropology and religious studies, it sheds some light on the popular conceptualization of the Hindu goddess, the logic behind the composition of her worship, especially in terms of performing arts, as well as the active power assigned to drama within the popular Hindu context."

    "abstract": "Despite the known benefits of physical activity, very few people, especially women, are found to engage in regular physical activity. This study explored the perceptions, barriers and facilitators related to physical activity among women in Thiruvananthapuram City. Results: Women associated physical activity mostly with household activities. The majority of the women considered their activity level adequate, although they engaged in what the researchers concluded were quite low levels of activity. Commonly reported barriers were lack of time, motivation, and interest; stray dogs; narrow roads; and not being used to the culture of walking. Facilitators of activity were seeing others walking, walking in pairs, and pleasant walking routes. Walking was reported as the most feasible physical activity by women. Conclusion: Physical activity promotion strategies among women should address the prevailing cultural norms in the community, and involve social norming and overcoming cultural barriers. They should also target the modifiable determinants of physical activity, such as improving self-efficacy, improving knowledge on the adequacy of physical activity and its recommendations, facilitating goal-setting, and enhancing social support through peer support and group-based activities."

The Active Network Group of Emergency Life Savers (ANGELS) was launched in 2011 in Calicut City, the third largest city in the Indian State of Kerala. \n\nThe ANGELS integrated an existing fleet of private and state-owned ambulances into a single network utilizing Global Positioning System technology and a single statewide call number. A total of 85 volunteer emergency medical certified technicians were trained in basic first aid and trauma care principles.\n\nPublic awareness campaigns accompanied all activities to raise awareness amongst community members. Funding was provided via public-private partnership, aimed to minimize costs to patients for service utilization.\n\nOver a two-year period from March 2011 to April 2013, 8,336 calls were recorded, of which 54.8% (4,569) were converted into actual ambulance run sheets. The majority of calls were for medical emergencies and most patients were transported to Medical College Hospital in Calicut.\n\nThis unique public-private partnership has been responsive to the needs of the population while sustaining low operational costs. This system may provide a relevant template for Emergency Medical Services development in other resource-limited settings."

Many encephalitis patients from this outbreak exhibited neurological sequelae post recovery.\n\nThis study was aimed to assess the clinical outcomes of West Nile encephalitis confirmed case-patients after 1 year of acute illness. Forty West Nile virus confirmed encephalitis patients were selected from the 2011 outbreak was included in this study. Out of 40 cases, only 30 survived after 12 months. Among these 30 recovered case-patients, 27 (90%) consented for clinical follow-up and 23 (73.67%) of them consented for assessment of cognitive impairment and deposition of blood sample for antibody testing.\n\nThe most common symptom observed in these patients was fatigue (25.93%). Other symptoms included dizziness (7.4%), decreased sense of hearing (7.4%) and decreased sense of smell (7.4%). Reduced power in limbs was found in 33.33% of the cases. Most of the patients (23.1%) were dependent on others for normal daily living activities. The patients also had probable risk of poor cognition (29.41%) and dementia (57.14%). None of the patients were positive for WNV specific IgM at 12 months post onset of disease.\n\nThe study concluded that the long-term sequelae were noticed in WNV positive patients. Prevention effort should be focused on the elderly (≥60 years old) people who have a higher risk of severe sequelae. The state health authorities should create awareness among people in order to prevent the transmission of disease."

    "abstract": "Locating itself within the debates on state-civil society relationship in the neoliberal era, this paper analyzes the community-led palliative care movement in Kerala and explores the nature of civil society participation and state patronage that made this movement highly successful in the state.\n\nThe paper explains how civil society organizations including religious groups play pivotal role by providing volunteers and ensuring resources from the community for the everyday functioning of this movement aimed at providing palliative care to the terminally ill.\n\nThe paper discusses the curious scenario where this initiative could persuade the state to replicate this model and incorporate it in the health delivery system of the government, thereby making Kerala the first state in India with an official palliative care policy and statewide support system in place.\n\nWhile discussing the specific socio-historic context that facilitated increased involvement of civil society organizations in the welfare programs in conjunction with the state in Kerala, the paper suggests that this experiment complicates the understanding of a neoliberal welfare state and highlights the necessity to analyze the local level manifestations of neoliberalism in different socio-political settings."

It is reinforced by the Human Development Index (HDI) position of Gujarat. \n\nKerala has performed positively in terms of social indicators but economy has been in disarray, as it is ranked among bottom half of the country.\n\nThis study is based on secondary data gathered from several government and international organizations. The article concludes by arguing that the governments should be equally concerned about both social development and economic development."

One aspect of the evolution considers the outer appearance of the travellers. An appearance may reflect traveller preferences and activities, and may also portray membership in a traveller subculture. In a survey conducted in Kerala, India, the dress and styles of independent Western travellers was studied by two samples: 30 interviews and 118 photographs. The survey was a comparative follow-up of another such study made in 1990s, in Rajasthan. According to the Kerala results, the travellers had become both more culture-sensitive and professional. Casual styles dominated in the increasingly touristic middle-class scene, together with a significant preference for outdoors attires. A countercultural ethos had survived, barely, in a secondary role, without deep commitment. Overall, the comparative analysis revealed both changes and similarities, in terms of women's dress codes and dressing according to occasion. Interestingly, the development toward a digitally connected flashpacker culture, often thought to be a major recent trend of independent travel, had gained unexpectedly limited ground in India."

The complexities of communal proliferation are products of entanglements of caste, conversion, economic mobility, and land relationship. Political discourses at the global stage and efforts in building identity-based alliances have a direct bearing on this region. Changing politics of both the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) also has a direct bearing on the social life of the Hindus, while the communitarian politics of Indian Union Muslim League, Islamic doctrinal debates, and neo-Salafisation are no less significant in the making of a new Muslim mindscape. These particularities then facilitate in the making of two oppositional and clannish identities in the region."

This article argues that this abysmal status of land ownership is the result of three exclusionary processes. \n\nDalits were historically excluded from land ownership due to the caste system. Second, they were consistently excluded from the process of land reforms in a significant way. Lastly, the current trends in land market activities tend to exclude them from land ownership.\n\nThis article shows how social inequality in land ownership in Kerala, known to be a progressive state, remains high. Dalits lag far behind in land ownership as compared to the upper castes reinforcing the fact that the land–caste nexus still dominates in Kerala."

    "abstract": "Ethnographic inquiry into Ayurvedic commodification in Kerala revealed the prevalence of a distinct regional pharmaceutical market dominated by physician-manufacturers, oriented towards supplying classical medicines to Ayurvedic doctors. This stands in sharp contrast to mainstream Ayurveda that is observed to have undergone biomedicalization and pharmaceuticalization.\n\nThis paper argues that Kerala's classical-medicine-centric pharmaceutical market constitutes an alternative modernity because it provided Kerala Ayurveda with a different route to modernization impervious to the biomedical regime, as well as endowing it with the institutional power to safeguard its regional identity.\n\nAlthough physician-entrepreneurs are its key architects, it is sustained by value regimes shaped by a unique regional medico-cultural milieu. Even when industrially produced, classical medicines remain embedded within Ayurveda's socio-technical network; unlike proprietary drugs sold as individual product-identities through non-Ayurvedic channels, they travel together as a pharmacopeia, distributed through exclusive doctor-mediated agencies.\n\nThis clinic-centric distribution format is best conceptualized as an open-source business model as it made low-margin generics viable by packaging them with therapies and services. Besides ensuring better access and affordability, it provided resistance to pharmaceuticalization and intellectual property concentration.\n\nBy keeping the doctor in the loop, it prevented medicines from degenerating into de-contextualized commodities; the service component of Ayurveda therein preserved went on become the unique selling point in the health-tourism market. \nThe tourism-inspired proliferation of Brand Kerala eventually triggered a paradigm shift in mainstream Ayurveda – shifting focus from ‘pharmaceuticals’ to ‘services’ and from ‘illness’ to ‘wellness’. Furthermore, interacting with hybrid Ayurvedas in transnational markets, Kerala Ayurveda co-produces new alterities countervailing the structurally dominant biomedical paradigm."

A subsample of 7,853 elderly from four demographically advanced states in South India formed the study population. \n\nResults showed that most of the elderly were working as unpaid workers in their later ages. A significant number of the elderly with primary or more education and living with their children without spouse or with other relatives worked as unpaid workers.\n\nMultivariate analyses suggest that those elderly living with their children were less likely to suffer from any morbidity and more likely to seek treatment. Economic well-being and usual activity status are significant predictors of morbidity and treatment-seeking behaviour.\n\nThose elderly who lived alone were more vulnerable to poor health and more likely to work for their livelihood.\n\nIrrespective of the living arrangement, treatment seeking among the elderly was relatively higher in Kerala compared with the rest of the states.\n\nThus, the family plays a significant role in elderly care, and living arrangement affects the work status and morbidity condition of the elderly population in the states of South India."

The model is illustrated through a case study of the Ration Card Management System in Kerala, South India: by capturing the causal chains underlying design–reality gaps, the model sets to trace the origins of failure, and the processes through which it is ultimately determined. \n\nThe model I propose is both explanatory and normative, as it elicits causes of failure and serves as a basis to combat them."

    "abstract": "This article seeks to make sense of a widely acclaimed political experiment in decentralisation and people-centred development in Kerala of the 1990s, the People’s Planning Campaign, by placing it within a wider contemporary history of politics in the region.\nMuch celebratory literature on this experiment has tended to view it as essentially an extension of pre-existing political initiatives in the state associated with mainstream left parties.\n\nMoving away from this view, the present analysis views it as a political response of the mainstream left to various challenges it faced in the early 1990s, to throw light on the many contradictions of political decentralisation in Kerala.\n\nFurther, it reflects on ‘glocalisation’ of participatory democracy in Kerala and the subject-positions it has produced."

    "abstract": "This article discusses the variation in response to the advent of the Portuguese on the Malabar Coast by different Muslim literary and intellectual figures.\n\nIt is argued that certain Arabic sources dealing with the history of Islam in Malabar and with jihād against the encroaching Portuguese in fact reveal cleavages and antagonisms within learned Muslim opinion. Both the content of these Arabic texts and the choice of genre by their authors are indicative of this internal conflict within the Malabar Muslim community. Thus, any view positing a monolithic or essentialist view of Malabar Muslims as such becomes untenable.\n\nOne well-known and previously translated work, Tuḥfat al-Mujāhidīn, by the well-known Malabari scholar Zain al-Din al-Ma‘bari has been misunderstood as entirely representative of the totality of opinion within the Malabari Muslim community. However, it will be argued that a second and hitherto understudied set of texts reveal another, and, startlingly different viewpoint.\n\nAll these works are clearly products of the conceptual world of jihādi discourse but present sharply opposed prescriptions for collective Muslim actions within Kerala. These divergent prescriptions are rooted in differing historical narratives and imaginaries capable of addressing a perceived profound crisis confronting Malabar Muslims."

The area taken up for study here is the erstwhile British Malabar (northern Kerala), from the early nineteenth to the early twentieth century. It attempts to relate the requirements of varied agrarian production regimes to the prevailing state system, tenurial systems and inequalities in land holding as well as social disparities represented by forms of caste differentiation."

    "abstract": "This article examines different patterns of “cosmopolitan capitalism” in three paired localities in China and India: (1) Zhejiang/Gujarat, (2) Zhongguancun/Bangalore, and (3) Guangdong/Kerala. The paired cases illustrate the attentiveness of the local state to transnational society and present varied expressions of the local developmental impact of remittances and return migration. Analytically, this article departs from conventional usages of both state and society by focusing on the local state in combination with a less territorial conception of society. The rationale for this dual definitional stretch—both downwards (local state) and outwards (transnational society)—has an empirical basis. First, the local government represents the day-to-day point of contact with “the state” for most people. Second, limiting the scope of “society” to populations currently residing within national borders unnecessarily excludes temporary migrants and diasporic communities who continue to identify with a locality. Theoretically, this article extends Albert Hirschman's classic categorical troika of “exit, voice, and loyalty” to the literature on new transnationalism."

    "abstract": "Secular governance in India was meant to have incorporated religion within public life, but the implementation of ‘Indian secularism’ has in important ways been premised on separating religious and secular lifeworlds. Public Hindu temples, whose assets and operations are managed by a melange of statutory bodies, courts, and state governments, exemplify this puzzling situation. The 2011 discovery of treasures within the Padmanabhaswamy temple in Trivandrum, Kerala, prompted extended public debate about the ownership of temple assets as well as litigation that eventually reached the Supreme Court of India. Indian citizens, erstwhile princely rulers, and the deity of the temple were variously presented as the true owners of the wealth. Ultimately, both public discourse and judicial opinion largely reaffirmed the notion that religious institutions are to be treated as private, contractually defined properties, and that temple wealth, as specifically religious property, exists outside of market circulations."

    "abstract": "This paper discusses the demographic and socio-economic profile of religious communities (castes among the Hindus, sects among the Muslims and denominations among the Christians) in Kerala’s three major religions — Hinduism, Islam, and Christianity. Such data are not presently available from other sources such as the population censuses. \n\nThe practice of collecting “caste” data was discontinued in the Indian censuses ever since India became independent in 1947. This study, based mainly on data from the Kerala Migration Surveys, is an attempt to fill this void for recent years. \n\nIt gives information on the size of the communities (population), trends, major demographic characteristics, selected socio-economic characteristics such as education, employment, migration and remittances, and several indices of the economic status at the household level. Lack of credible “caste” data to tell us who deserves preferential treatment could be the main cause that prompts some communities to make unreasonable demands for reservation.\n\nAnalysis of the long-term trends in population of the three religious groups indicates that the Hindus who were more than two-thirds of the state’s population in the beginning of the last century, could be less than 50 per cent of the state’s population by the middle of the present century. On the other hand, by then, the Muslims who were fewer than the Christians during much of the last century, could become more than double the Christian population and exceed one-third of the state’s population. However, the Muslims are unlikely to overtake the Hindus in the matter of population size as their fertility rate would also dip to below-replacement-level in the span of 10 to 15 years.\n\nAlthough the population of all the three religious groups had increased during 2001-2011 at the state level, in 4 out of the 14 districts and 26 out of the 63 taluks, the number of Christians is seen to have decreased. Similarly, in 3 of the districts and 16 of the taluks, the number of Hindus decreased. There were decreases even among the Muslims in one district and 7 taluks. These statistics give sufficient indication that some of the communities among the religious groups could have decreased during 2001-2011.\n\nThe analysis of this study confirms that this conclusion is correct. It showed that, during 2001-2011 while the proportions of the larger communities among the three religious groups (the Sunnis among the Muslims, the Ezhavas among the Hindus, and the Syro-Malabar Catholics among the Christians) in the population of the state have increased, the corresponding proportions of the smaller ones, the non-Catholic Episcopal Syrian Christian denominations (the Jacobites, the Orthodox, and the Mar Thoma Syrians), the Nairs, and Shia Muslims have decreased and are likely to continue their decreasing trend.\n\nSurprisingly, the Syro Malankara community, although part of the Catholic group, has followed the path of the non-Catholic Syrian group from whom they separated themselves some 85 years ago. In recent years, the non-Catholic Episcopal Syrian Christian denominations have been at the top of the socio-economic ladder of the state, but the emerging differential population growth path of these communities, which entails an increasing load of old-age dependents, could have considerable adverse impacts on their relative role in the emerging political economy of the state.\n\nAccording to the earlier Kerala Migration Surveys, the Mar Thoma Syrian Community was at the top with respect to most of the socio-economic indicators, but by 2014, they have lost their top spot to the other Syrian Christian communities. It is only a matter of time before these communities also pass on their high ranking to other religious communities. This is transition in the demographic dividend."

The major antecedents such as customer perceived eco-literacy, perceived individual benefits, perceived customer effectiveness and perceived customer social responsibility were identified from prior empirical evidence. The skepticism in the minds of the customer about green claims was demonstrated by verifying the moderating role of perceived green wash fear on development of green purchase behaviour. The constructs in this study were conceptualized as reflective or formative based on theoretical considerations. \n\nA cross-sectional study was conducted in which perceptions of 188 retail customers from Cochin area in Kerala state of India were collected using a structured questionnaire. Variance-based structural equation modelling was used to analyze the linkage among variables of importance. \n\nThe study found that, other than perceived customer effectiveness, all other variables significantly developed green purchase intentions. The perceived green wash fear was found to be significantly moderating all significant antecedents in the theoretical framework. The study concluded that for sustainable development, green-wash practices should be curbed effectively and customers should be properly and correctly informed about green properties of the products."

The analysis has been conducted by using logistic regression model.\n\nThis study finds that either (a) an increase in the number of working members in a family household, or (b) presence of Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) employed members in a family household or (c) an increase in the expenditure on assets by members of a family household is likely to increase the real income of the family household.\n\nHowever, the presence of educated members in a family household is less likely to increase the real income of the family household.\n\nOur study suggests that the employability of the educated members is crucial for achieving positive changes in the real income of a family household. \n\nThis study finds no evidence for the impact of total loan amount of family households on changes in their real income, since most loans are drawn for non-income generation purposes, pointing out that the loan amount should be spent on economically valuable assets, as it raises the real income of family households participating in the microfinance programme."

It examines the progression of population vulnerability from a political economy perspective. \n\nA mixed methodology design was adopted to carry out the study. Data from 50 migrants in each of the three cities were collected using a semi-structured interview schedule. The research demonstrates that urban vulnerability is a condition that shapes and reshapes itself continuously and fiercely, accompanied by the processes and structures of unplanned rapid urbanisation, environmental change and social exclusion.\n\nA significant feature of migrant workers’ vulnerability is its multi-dimensionality. This paper suggests that urban planners involved in environmental governance and risk reduction have to critically reflect on certain terminologies and practices in the field of climate change, while addressing these multi-dimensionalities."

In this cross-sectional community-based study, in 202 antenatal women, standard interview and diagnostic criteria were employed for identifying depression and examining a wide range of putative clinical and sociocultural risk factors including domestic violence. \n\nThere was a 16.3% prevalence of depression among the 202 women sampled. The possible risk factors after stepwise backward regression were pressure to have a male child, financial difficulties, non-arranged marriage, history of miscarriage–still birth, and marital conflict. There is a need to develop strategies for recognition and appropriate intervention for antenatal depression, in the context of locally relevant risk factors, so as to improve both maternal and child outcomes."

    "abstract": "Between the late 1950s and the 1960s, a significant community of Indians appeared in Seria, an oil town in Brunei. Most of these Indians were recruited from India by the British Malayan Petroleum Company to staff its company offices in the wake of the rehabilitation of the Seria oilfields after the end of the Japanese occupation of Borneo. However, in official hagiographies of the Sultanate and historical accounts of Brunei, the Indians of Seria are invisible. Juxtaposed against this silence in the historical record, I pose the narrative agency of these Indians in asserting their place in the emergence of the modern state of Brunei and in historicizing their presence in a frontier oil town in Borneo. This article is based on extensive fieldwork in India, where most of these Indians retired to after decades of expatriate life in Brunei. Recalling their work and youth in Seria, they collectively claim an ‘origin’ in Seria while improvising a Brunei-Indian diaspora in India through their shared memories. In the absence of an archival record for the Indians in Seria, this article seeks to affirm the historical value of story-telling and diasporic remembering in recording a partisan genealogy of migration and settlement."

    "abstract": "This article takes issue with prominent ways of interpreting the cosmopolitanism often attributed to Kerala. By virtue of its geographical location, from medieval times Kerala developed deep historical connections with European, Arabian, and South-East Asian societies. However in contemporary evocations of Kerala’s cosmopolitanism, the historical connections to South-East Asian societies are conspicuous by their absence. Caste Hindu legacies have been privileged implicitly in these and, as a result, hybrid communities can only be perceived as “miscegenated”. They are, therefore, excluded from the legacies of national culture. Johny Miranda’s recent novella Requiem for the Living (2013), tries to end this invisibility by articulating the present of one such community, the Parankis of Cochin. On the one hand, it both challenges and complicates existing identities such as the “Anglo-Indian” and the “Luso-Indian”, revealing their elite moorings and dualistic conception of hybridity. On the other hand, it departs from the long history of the implications of novel-writing in projects of caste-community identity construction in Malayali society. In doing so, it directs our attention towards the possibilities of unearthing “subaltern cosmopolitanism”, which may indeed be more appropriate for contemporary challenges in the specific postcolonial context that is contemporary Kerala."

In addition, we examine the labour supply behaviour of women whose husbands have migrated abroad. After controlling for potential endogeneity using the instrument variable (IV-probit) approach, estimates show that the supply of male and female left-behind members in market work decreases. While international migration results in the relocation of labour supply of male left-behind members from salary and casual wage workers to self-employed workers, it increases female left-behind members’ participation in household duties and reduces their participation in unpaid family work. The heterogeneity effect confirms that the impact of international migration is greater in rural than in urban areas."

    "abstract": "Education and education exclusion are two mammoth social and political challenges in a society characterized by diverse social groups. Although ‘self-financing regime’ helped to barricade the outflow of money from the state, it also hampered the ‘social equity’ in education and hence germinated the seed of education exclusion in Kerala. The data for the study have been collected through a field survey involving 900 students belonging to three professional study disciplines in a social-class framework based on multi-stage stratified random sampling. Factor analysis, correspondence analysis and binary logistic regression have been used to epitomize the significant factors that play a key role in the process of education exclusion in a social-class framework based on student perception. Empirical realities affirm significant relations for the presence of education exclusion among the marginalized social groups. Skill rating based on social category shows a clear inter-community difference with Scheduled Castes / Scheduled Tribes coming in the low/medium and low-skill index, whereas the general and the Other Backward Class / other eligible communities featuring closer to medium-high and high-skill index. A demand–supply evaluation is necessary for policy nesting, with a view of understanding the gap involved in the process as part of the professional education planning in the state."

    "abstract": "This article analyses the series of strikes initiated by staff nurses in private hospitals in the state of Kerala. In spite of the growth of private sector health care institutions, working terms and conditions of nursing professionals are structured by a deeply iniquitous ethos. A number of strikes were organised that generated public interest and resulted in some potential long-term changes in the perspectives on health care professionals’ recruitment and terms of work. How did the nurses in the private sector negotiate their demand for better working conditions using strike as a strategy? What were the responses of the key stakeholders and the general public? It is obvious that gender mediated the negotiations between the state, private sector hospital managements and unions, on the one hand, and nurses who were predominantly women, on the other. In that case, what were the ways in which gender was factored into the discussions? This bears important implications for the regulation and governance of the private health care sector. This article thus argues that the legislation on clinical establishments should be expedited and any attempt to jeopardise it should be resisted; rather there should be collective efforts to work on the shortcomings of the Clinical Establishment (Registration and Regulation) Bill."

    "abstract": "Control over social space was central to the everyday practice of caste in Kerala. Caste system in Kerala had evolved extreme forms of control over social space, which was critiqued by European missionaries in the 19th century.\n\nThe missionary work among the slave castes that emphasised learning prayers and the Gospel provided the untouchable slaves with a new conceptual language. This was central to the claims of slave castes to the social space as they could come together defying the caste rules and regulations of distance pollution for prayer meetings which began in the slave schools and chapels in the evening after a day’s back-breaking labour in their landlords’ fields. \n\nThe slave schools and chapels created a new social space that enabled the slave castes to claim all other modern social spaces. The slaves took over new cultural practices such as forming social organisations from the missionaries and used them effectively in their congregational activities. \n\nThe experiences of social movements such as the Prathyaksha Raksha Daiva Sabha (PRDS) show that the former slave castes could effectively use prayer as a powerful instrument to claim social space which was highly structured and inegalitarian."

This article analyzes Kerala’s land question from the perspective of social equity and shows that even after the much touted land reform, land inequality in the state stands very high, whether measured in terms of overall distribution inequality or social inequality. The land reform, along with other factors, resulted in the preponderance of small and marginal holdings. In the social front, the marginalized communities still stand at the bottom of land ownership. The persisting inequality in land ownership has significant stakes in the upward mobility of the marginalized groups. The study reveals that land ownership is an important variable affecting the educational level of households and that land reform in the state widened the opportunities for occupational mobility among the marginalized groups."

This ‘Presence’ is created by integrating the physical and emotional elements of the performer’s embodied being. \n\nThe paper focuses on one important element of the Kathakali aesthetic – bhava – and critiques existing literature to offer a more nuanced understanding of bhava as an embodied ‘emotional state’. It looks at the craft of embedding bhava into the performer’s body. This process is complicated by what Drew Leder in his work The Absent Body suggests as the phenomenology of the ‘disappearing body’. \n\nThe paper further highlights individual Kathakali training practices and looks to see how they negotiate the idea of the ‘disappearing body’ and by this contribute to crafting the performer’s embodied ‘Presence’ on stage."

    "abstract": "From the vast literature of classical and medieval Sanskrit drama, only one tradition of live performance has survived—the intricate, elaborate, and refined art form known as Kūṭiyāṭṭam, still performed by a handful of families in central and southern Kerala on the south-west coast of India. To be precise : performances of Kūṭiyāṭṭam now tend to be truncated, reduced to two or three hours in a single night, as opposed to the full-length performances that would normally range from twelve hours to over 150 hours spread out over many days or nights. Since the older economic basis of the tradition in temple endowments has been lost, this art now competes in the open market with all other, modern forms, including contemporary cinema. Nonetheless, in recent years, under the aegis of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, full-length Kuṭiyāṭṭam productions by the Nepathya team of Mūḻikkuḷam have been re-introduced, and major parts of the classical repertoire are now once again amenable to viewing and study. An analytical study of the tradition must address a series of primary questions : Why have the performances, always limited to a single act of one of the classical texts, taken the strange shape we find today, with its central structural feature of imaginative retrospection (nirvahaṇam) ? What is the nature of the expressivity embodied in these complex performances ? Are there thematic unities at work ? How are we to understand the radical personalization of the character as presented to us over many hours on stage ? Can we define the peculiar, contrasting temporalities at work in these performances ? How is the Sanskrit text related to the immense expansion and exegesis that the actors generate ? What is the effect —cognitive, affective, aesthetic, sensual— upon the spectator of a performance that runs for 130 hours ? What is the aim of the actor as ritualist ?"

Most of the patients (60%) were in the productive phase of life (age range, 18–45 years). The outcome was worst among those aged over 65 years. A definite seasonal trend was observed with a peak in incidence with the arrival of the monsoon in Kerala. Public awareness regarding fevers in the pre-monsoon season should be heightened. Special care should be given to the elderly as they are often the most vulnerable. The use of the proposed locally-based algorithm may avoid unnecessary investigations and treatment."

Field study was carried out between  September 2011 and August 2012 in Kerala. The ethnomedicinal information was collected through interviews, informal meetings, open and group discussions and overt observations with semi-structured questionnaires among traditional healers. The collected data were analyzed through ICF and fidelity level. In regards to usage, 68 species utilized as food products and medicinal uses, totaled 98.55% followed by one species for cosmetics (1.45%). This study indicated that the animals are still being used by the local healers of Palakkad district, to treat various illnesses.

Multiple regression analysis showed that patients using oral hypoglycemic agents, who had lower per capita monthly expenditure, those with irregular blood sugar monitoring, who received limited diabetes management instructions from health professionals, who resorted to only symptomatic management, and those who did not receive family member’s help to remember medications were more likely to report poor adherence compared with their counterparts."

The existing tools are inadequate to measure the construct, especially in a community where the self-statement format of a scale is difficult to internalize. The authors constructed a tool from an initial item pool with the help of experts and validated it in a sample of 326 young people in the state of Kerala, India. Factor analysis gave 4 underlying factors for the construct of PMH. The findings prove that the scale, named the Achutha Menon Centre Positive Mental Health Scale, is reliable and valid and can be used in both individual- and population-based studies for measuring PMH."

This is the first ethnobotanical study in which statistical calculations about plants are done by the Pearson correlation coefficient method. The field study was carried out over a period of 2 years (2011–2013) using semi-structured interviews with 66 informants (most of the informants belonged to an age between 50 and 70 years) in six remote locations in the hills. A total of 85 medicinal plants belonging to 49 families were reported to be used against 19 different ailments in the hills. In this study, we have documented considerable indigenous knowledge about the native medicinal plants in Nelliyampathy hills for treating common ailments. The plants such as further investigated phytochemically and pharmacologically which leads to natural drug discovery development may be based on the present study. The study has various socioeconomic dimensions which are associated with the local communities."

It complicates the argument that private schools have become spaces in which young people come to see themselves less as representatives of one ethnic or caste community and more as indices of their own family’s economic standing and as members of a class group. I argue that a closer look at the way in which students experience and narrativise private schooling reveals a much less straightforward process. Schools, I argue, are mobilised by youth as flexible tools in complex and competing strategies to construct a middle social space for themselves. The article seeks to address the lack of research on the complex and severely contested processes of transformation of the selves implicated in strategies of urban educational opportunities."

The impact of religious revivalism shows how religion has become a site for various identity-based community-centred networks among South Asian immigrants to Gulf countries. The article analyses the ways in which the church is increasingly active among Syrian Christian immigrants of Kerala in post-liberation Kuwait. Such religious groups are transnational in nature, actively linked to both home and destination countries, and the world beyond. The article focuses specifically on the growing affinity of Syrian Christian immigrants towards Pentecostalism. At the macro level, this article also investigates the interconnection between the geopolitical dynamics in the Gulf and the expansion of what appears to be ‘religious space’ in Kuwait."

    "tags": "Caste; Hinduism; History & Archaeology",
    "abstract": "The article seeks to argue that the making of jāti was homologous with the opening up of deltas for agriculture, involving integration of agro-pastoral descent groups into hereditary specialists of occupational identity, and formation of stratified relations of production transcending kin labour. It emphasises that productive relations in the deltas had preconditions such as hereditary occupations, asymmetrical social relations, amenability to differential allocation of status, and the dominant presence of the Brāhman, as with tacitly recognized ritual supremacy, resource potential, social control, political influence and cultural pre-eminence for the emergence of jāti hierarchy. A related argument is that the emergence of hereditary occupation groups and promulgation of sāstraic norms must have been processes of mutuality and concurrence. It has been understood the context of the Jāti institution of coercive control and seigniorial jurisdiction over the labouring body was crucial. As regards proliferation of jāti-s, the argument is that it had been an ongoing process ever since jāti became the dominant paradigm of identity construction for occupational groups and service personnel claiming socio-cultural distinction on the basis of their association with the seigniorial power. Rewarded under land-tenure, the personnel in service to the king and the local chieftains became hereditary for stability of service as well as permanence of family landholding. Illustrating the historical experience of the Tamil South in general and the Kerala region in particular, the argument found feasible is that the proliferation of jāti-s happened as a land tenure-based phenomenon under the three seigniorial streams represented by the king, the chieftain and the temple – brahmadēya combine, as realized in terms of the sāstraic norms."

It stops in the mid-1990s, when decentralisation and women’s self-help groups began a new phase of social change. It focuses mainly on changing vicissitudes of land, politics, work and domestic life in this urban slum to reflect on the specific form of marginalisation that the residents of this pocket of extreme disadvantage have suffered since its earliest days, in the mid-twentieth century, which I refer to as ‘marginalisation by abjection’. It also examines the usefulness of widely used concepts such as ‘political society’ to make sense of politics there, and concludes by cautioning against the perfunctory use of concepts such as political society and clientelism."

It would be argued that though the ‘enlightened’ government in the princely state of Travancore realised the importance of developing health programmes to cope up with public health issues, particularly because of the frequent incidence of famines, their efforts remained half-hearted and the investments remained far low. On the other hand, the missionaries were more active in setting up hospitals and dispensaries and these prove to be beneficial for the ‘lower castes’. However, though the missionaries and the ruling circles in Travancore remained divided in matters related to religion, there was some element of cooperation between them in this respect. The health-related issues moved in new dimension altogether when there were active interventions on behalf of the Rockefeller Foundation and the proponents of Ayurveda in early-twentieth-century Travancore."

It argues that there is a shift away from the principles of dissent and radical egalitarianism in the course of contemporary Indian art and that the biennale is an exemplary case of this turn."

This was a descriptive cum qualitative study conducted in Thariode Gramapanchayat in the Wayanad district of Kerala. The determinants of utilisation in tribal women were general awareness, affordability, accessibility and quality of services along with motivation by health workers. Among tribal antenatal women, 85% utilized maternal health care facilities fully compared to 100% among non-tribal women. Lower levels of education and lack of transport facilities were prime factors contributing to under utilization by tribal women. Affordable, accessible and good quality of services in the public health system in Kerala and motivation by health workers were important contributing factors for better utilisation of maternal care services."

The study illustrates the historiographical potentialities of community and travel narratives by exploring the possibilities of diverse readings of the past. \n\nThrough a close scrutiny of two early narratives, Tuhfat al-Mujahidin (16th century) and Varthamanappusthakam (18th century), the author tries to unravel some of the hitherto unnoticed contours of the cultural geography of the region from which evolved the state of Kerala. And by an alternative reading of history through these narratives it is argued that the nationalist non-religious imagination of the secular was tantamount to undermining minority identities. \n\nThe two texts under analysis bring out the fact that the minority identities of the sixteenth century Mappila (Muslim) and the eighteenth century Nazrani (Christian) communities were shaped by religious imagination as against the nationalist assumptions. Accordingly, it has been well argued that in the colonial context in which these identity assertions were shaped had in the process as the 'other' not the native Hindu but the alien Portuguese. \n\nSignificantly departing from the Poststructuralist assumptions of community and by resorting to the New Historicist conceptualizations, the study offers a critique of the received western notions of secularism as contra religion and establishes that the eastern tradition of secularism has always been deeply religious. \n\nThe study is well-wrought within the theoretical perspective that text is historical and history textual, and exemplifies the discursive convergence of the literary and the non-literary sources which could fruitfully be used in interpretation and inquiry especially in reading the past."

    "abstract": "Between 1900 and 1904, the celebrated Indian academic painter Raja Ravi Varma painted two depictions of men reading (plate 1 and plate 2). The works are unusual, so much so, as to be quite unrecognizable from the mythological paintings and princely portraits that earned Ravi Varma his reputation with patrons and clients. Ravi Varma was best known for his paintings of lovelorn women gazing comely at the viewer and although men had featured in several commissioned portraits they were rarely presented as idealised figures. His sketchbooks feature several examples of men in everyday scenes, so it is evident that he experimented with the idea but very few seem to have made the transition to a final painting. The two small paintings are not strictly portraits in the sense that there is no information on them being commissioned, nor do they present particular, distinctive individuals but rather represent characters within environments. They are, more properly, genre paintings that portray the subjects within scenes of contemporary life. At least two other paintings of men exist from the same period, The Retired Soldier (1902) and The Miser (1901) both of which are largely anthropological in nature. In the scholar paintings however, Ravi Varma attempts to go beyond the dominant paradigms of anthropological portraiture or studio portraits of the period in exploring the subjective potential of the Indian man in his private universe, a characterization that is explored with much empathy and sensitivity and throws light on the idealised male self in turn of the century Kerala."

    "abstract": "What explains the pattern of communist vote across rural India? One explanation is that landless populations will vote for left parties because they are more willing to engage with risky groups. But does land reform change the risk structure for rural voters and how does this change affect the viability of left parties? This article uses Ordinary Least Squares regression to understand what percentage of communist vote can be explained by landlessness in three of India’s Lok Sabha elections. Analysis finds that landlessness is still a significant explanation of communist vote across India but not when controlling for left strongholds in West Bengal and Kerala, meaning that structural variables are moderated by the duration of communist regime. This finding lends evidence to the idea that long term communist regimes can successfully redistribute wealth in a society to reduce structural differences among peasants. Changes in land tenure increase economic risk for peasant voters, and as recent elections have shown, decrease the viability of communist parties. To further this point, I supplement my results by case study analysis of West Bengal and Kerala, thus explicating the mechanisms leading to the more recent upheaval of communist support."

Analysis of 49 semistructured interviews and survey data from 3,181 female workers revealed that although women were mainly responsible for domestic labor, more than half of husbands usually or sometimes helped their wives with cooking, fuel wood collection, and child care. The analyses revealed a curvilinear relationship between husbands' earnings share and their participation in each task, supporting theories of bargaining and gender display. The probability of male participation decreased to its lowest level when men earned less than their wives. Husbands rarely helped with clothes washing—considered the most feminine task—and their participation did not respond to changes in relative earnings. These results support the authors' argument that patterns of bargaining and gender display will vary depending on the gendered nature of housework tasks within a particular society."

    "abstract": "Introduction: Motorcyclists comprise the majority of road-traffic victims in low and middle income countries,and consequently, the majority of the road-traffic victims globally. Simple measures can be taken to make safer on the roads, which include enforcement of safety measures like seat belt and helmets. The compulsory Helmet law was enforced in Kerala on 18/06/07. Resistance to legislation on motorcycle helmets still coexists world wide with debate on the effectiveness of helmets. In an attempt to analyze the protective effect of helmets on facial injuries a comparative study was conducted in Government Dental College, Calicut, which is a major trauma centre in northern Kerala.\n\nMethods: Data for the present study was obtained from the patients who have reported to the Emergency Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Government Dental College, Calicut, for a period of 6 months immediately after the implementation of strict helmet rule in Kerala. For the study all patients with a history of nonfatal motor cycle accident sustaining facial injuries were included. The results were compared with the study conducted in the same institution in the pre law period.\n\nResults: The study demonstrates the protective effect of motorcycle helmets in decreasing the morbidity of maxillofacial trauma.There was a marked decrease in incidence of motorcycle-related injuries, remarkable increase in helmet usage and better outcome in helmeted individuals in the post law period.\n\nConclusion: Road traffic injury control is a public health problem. Health and medical professionals have an ethical responsibility to educate and arrange for the safety of individuals. Helmets are effective in preventing or reducing the severity of motorcycle-related injuries and in a developing country like India, enforced mandatory motor cycle helmet law is potentially one of the most cost effective interventions available."

    "abstract": "This paper argues for proleptic restorative justice in the area of the environment in the form of a ‘human trust’. Drawing inspiration from the Roman public trust, the human trust insists that some ‘goods’ are so important that they can neither be owned nor spoiled; rather, they must be protected. In order to explain this model, water rights will be used as an example, specifically, the case of Plachimada’s battle with Coca-Cola over the use of local ground water in Kerala, India. This case allows consideration of the protection of water for people, the ongoing privatization of natural resources, and the strength of property rights. The human trust questions the merit of seeing the environment as property or in economic terms. Moreover, the human trust urges proleptic restorative justice, as in the case of the environment, restoration after the fact is often impossible. The potential harm is so extreme that one can argue for an action in tort of ‘anticipatory negligence’, a development of the quia timet injunction."

    "abstract": "The status of the endemic and endangered lion-tailed macaque (Macaca silenus) has not been properly assessed in several regions of the Western Ghats of southern India. We conducted a study in Parambikulam Forest Reserve in the state of Kerala to determine the distribution, demography, and status of lion-tailed macaques. We laid 5km2 grid cells on the map of the study area (644km2) and made four replicated walks in each grid cell using GPS. We gathered data on lion-tailed macaque group locations, demography, and site covariates including trail length, duration of walk, proportion of evergreen forest, height of tallest trees, and human disturbance index. We also performed occupancy modeling using PRESENCE ver. 3.0. We estimated a minimum of 17 groups of macaques in these hills. Low detection and occupancy probabilities indicated a low density of lion-tailed macaques in the study area. Height of the tallest trees correlated positively whereas human disturbance and proportion of evergreen forest correlated negatively with occupancy in grid cells. We also used data from earlier studies carried out in the surrounding Anamalai Tiger Reserve and Nelliyampathy Hills to discuss the conservation status in the large Anamalai Hills Landscape. This landscape harbors an estimated population of 1108 individuals of lion-tailed macaques, which is about one third of the entire estimated wild population of this species. A conservation plan for this landscape could be used as a model for conservation in other regions of the Western Ghats."

Most instances were sexual advances while using public transport. Feelings of insecurity and isolation at home, of being disliked by parents and of being depressed were significantly more in adolescents who had experienced sexual abuse, compared to those who had not.\n\nConclusions : Sexual abuse is widely prevalent and both boys and girls are equally susceptible. There is a need to evolve strategies to protect children from sexual abuse and the programmes should address both boys and girls."

    "abstract": "To examine gender disparities in cognitive functioning in India and the extent to which education explains this disparity in later life. This study uses baseline interviews of a prospective cohort study of 1,451 community-residing adults 45 years of age or older in four geographically diverse states of India (Karnataka, Kerala, Punjab, Rajasthan). Data collected during home visits includes cognitive performance tests, and rich sociodemographic, health, and psychosocial variables. The cognitive performance tests include episodic memory, numeracy, and a modified version of the Mini-Mental State Examination. We find gender disparity in cognitive function in India, and this disparity is greater in the north than the south. We also find that gender disparities in educational attainment, health, and social and economic activity explain the female cognitive disadvantage in later life. We report significant gender disparities in cognitive functioning among older Indian adults, which differ from gender disparities in cognition encountered in developed countries. Our models controlling for education, health status, and social and economic activity explain the disparity in southern India but not the region-specific disparity in the northern India. North Indian women may face additional sources of stress associated with discrimination against women that contribute to persistent disadvantages in cognitive functioning at older ages."

    "abstract": "Over time, the state of Kerala has systematically outperformed the rest of India in terms of literacy outcomes, establishing a strong positive record in this respect. Two main, explanations exist for this phenomenon. The first being the unique historical endowment inherited from the pro-education and social policies from the nineteenth century kingdom of Travancore and Cochin (South-Central Kerala) and secondly state activism initiated with the social reforms movement in the late 1950s. Using historical Census data and Employment-Unemployment rounds of the National Sample Survey, we find state activism was critical in achieving mass literacy in Kerala. Though historical endowment established a tradition of competitive demand for education across certain communities which largely explains the existing differences in higher education indicators between the Travancore-Cochin and the Non Travancore-Cochin regions, its contribution to improve education metrics of Scheduled Castes (vulnerable segment) was minimal."

To control for selectivity bias and to assess the average impact of remittances on household expenditure items, the present paper applies propensity score matching technique. The estimates reveal that compared to non-recipient households, households receiving remittances spend less on food and more on education and health care. Increasing expenditure with remittance flow on these critical variables signifies the positive impact of remittances on household development. The impact of international remittances on these indicators weighs more than internal. In line with the optimistic view, the findings of the present study show that remittances enhance household well-being."

    "abstract": "Land-use change is a phenomenon highlighting significant shifts in human interaction with the natural environment. Different patterns of agriculture and a trend towards non-agricultural land use challenge the sustainability of farming systems. This study aims to identify the causes of changes in land use and cropping patterns, with a special focus on paddy, the staple crop in Asia. In the case of Wayanad, a district in Kerala, South India, we argue for an interdisciplinary analysis of rapid land-use change to unpack the multiple dimensions of sustainability: economic, ecological and social factors, aggregating up to 70% reduction in the area under paddy by 2010. The results rest on empirical field research, participatory rural appraisals and stakeholder workshops conducted during the 4-year period from 2010 to 2013, along with state- and district-level data covering the 1983–2011 period. Reduced economic viability, labour shortages and population pressure on land are the major drivers for the transformation of paddy fields to other land uses. Changes in land use and agrarian structure reflect not only the livelihood strategies adopted by farmers in response to these drivers, but also the impacts of unintended policy idiosyncrasies. At a more fundamental level, they are the consequences of policy conflicts and inadequate sectoral integration of policies and implementation strategies."

Methodology: A cross-sectional questionnaire-based survey was conducted by personally approaching Heads of Institutions/Ethics Committee (EC) in-charge of all dental colleges (23) in Kerala. The validated questionnaire consisted of two parts. The first part pertained to details of institutions, and the second part assessed the structure and functioning of the IEC. The data obtained was tabulated and analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: Of the participating 17 colleges, 13 colleges had a functioning IEC. Only four of these IECs were accredited to a central agency. Only one among the 12 colleges completely adhered to recommended structure. Regarding the functioning of IECs, 69% of the IECs had neither a separate application form for ethical review of proposals nor a proforma for its evaluation. On average, more than ten proposals were reviewed in a single EC meeting in 54% of the colleges. Nearly 40% of the IECs had no representation of a lay person. Conclusion: The absence of IEC in four colleges and non-accreditation to a central agency was a matter of concern. Enforced accreditation is the need of the hour to ensure ethical protection to human participants."

The results showed that perceived supervisor support and psychological empowerment positively influenced employee engagement and perceived supervisor support positively influenced psychological empowerment. Also, it was found that psychological empowerment fully mediated the relationship between perceived supervisor support and employee engagement. This research adds to the current body of literature by providing insight into the influence of perceived supervisor support and psychological empowerment on employee engagement in the Indian context."

    "abstract": "In Kerala, young people, especially women, are encouraged to become nurses in order to migrate abroad for work and thereby improve the financial status of their family. Meanwhile, many of their parents remain in India by themselves. \n\nThis is occurring in the context of a strong popular discourse of elder abandonment, related to the local norms of intergenerational co-habitation. \n\nBased on fieldwork in Kerala and one of the nurses’ destination countries, Oman, the author presents evidence that complicates this discourse by showing how: (1) migration is a form of elder-care practice in itself; and (2) care for the elderly continues across countries and continents with the help of information and communication technologies (ICTs). \n\nUsing the theoretical approaches of science and technology studies, the author analyses ICTs as key members of care collectives and argues that ICTs have a significant role in reshaping care relations at a distance."

The main objective of the chapter is to sift the relationship between widowhood and disability by gender. \n\nIt examines the factors affecting female elderly with the disability and measures both subjective and objective disabilities. This study is evidenced from the Kerala Ageing Survey (KAS), 2013, with a sample of 7668 elderly in which 58% are females. \n\nThree major physical disabilities, namely vision, hearing, and walking, and mental disabilities, such as cognitive impairment and depression, are to be analyzed through the data. Before that, disability trends and prevalence of both India and Kerala by age and sex are closely examined through census figures. \n\nIt is revealed that elderly women are at risk of many factors compared to their male counterparts. They are vulnerable to multiple disabilities. The prevalence of disability is more among elderly females after the age of 70. The main physical problem of elderly is vision followed by movement and hearing impairment."

    "abstract": "Ageing in India is leading to an increase in chronic diseases. Given the limited health insurance coverage, this could lead to a variety of economic- and access-related consequences for the households. \n\nAgainst this backdrop, this article aims at examining the impact of the presence of the elderly on household health expenditure, avoidance of treatment, loss of income and use of alternate sources of funding to pay for care. \n\nThe article uses data from 2004 National Sample Survey Organisation survey on healthcare for two Indian states, namely, Bihar and Kerala. The rate of catastrophic health expenditure (CHE) is found to be higher in Kerala and is associated with a higher proportion of households having elderly members, who, in turn, have higher incidence of chronic disease. \n\nWhile the presence of elderly in the household, incidence of chronic disease and treatment from private sources are linked to CHE, our results suggest that other groups, such as households without elderly, may simply be delaying the economic consequences of paying for healthcare by borrowing. \n\nThough the ageing population is leading to increased health expenditure for households due to increased chronic illness, the impact of using private treatment is much less clear."

The practice of institutionalizing the elderly is a broad spreading concept in the modern world, and the old age homes and hospices are growing day by day. The current study aims at exploring the life experiences of the elderly on account of the transition happening due to institutionalization.\n\nThe current study followed the multiple case study design. The objectives of the study are 1) to understand the social conditions that propel the elderly to choose institutional care, 2) to assess changing the attitude of the elderly towards the society and 3) to determine the coping mechanisms by the elderly in institutions, towards effective adjustment. Samples were selected from the old age homes who were above the age of 65 and institutionalized for at least ten years.\n\nFour case studies focused on the current objectives, and semi-structured interview guide was used. The study found that there was some level of psychosocial issues among the elderly and need psychosocial interventions and specialized care for the elderly in the primary, secondary and tertiary levels."

    "abstract": "In recent times, trend analysis and change point detection in hydroclimatic variables receiving significant attention due to climate change and its socioeconomic consequences. In this study, long-term trends of rainfall in four subdivisions of southern India namely Kerala, Tamil Nadu, North Interior (NI) Karnataka and Telangana regions are analysed using linear regression, nonparametric Mann–Kendall (MK) test and Sen's slope estimator methods. Trend analysis of annual rainfall time series shows an increasing trend in three subdivisions – Tamil Nadu, NI Karnataka and Telangana, and a decreasing trend in Kerala subdivision. Further the sequential change in trend of annual and seasonal rainfalls in the four subdivisions is conducted using sequential MK (SQMK) method. The SQMK analysis shows an early divergence of progressive and retrograde modes of post-monsoon rainfall of Kerala and winter rainfall of Telangana subdivisions. Further it is observed that among different seasonal rainfalls, the post-monsoon rainfall of Kerala subdivision shows a statistically significant increase in the recent past. Then the trend analysis based on discrete wavelet transform (DWT) in conjunction with SQMK method is performed on the post-monsoon rainfall time series of Kerala subdivision, and the results show that there is a dominancy of short-term periodicity of less than a decade in the subdivision."

The driving force of epochal changes in Kuttanad was the transformation of the commons; different regimes that ruled Kuttanad have actively engaged in the appropriation, distribution, and production of commons along with and for the dominant sections in the region. Reclamation and re-reclamation of backwater lands, spanning over one-and-half centuries, are thus carried out by the distributive state apparatus in collaboration with its constituent class sections. The resultant shifts in land, crop, labour, technology, and resources are what define the crisis of commons in the region."

    "abstract": "Kerala, a maritime state of India is bestowed with abundant rainfall which is about three times the national average. This study is conducted to have a better understanding of rainfall variability and trend at regional level for this state during the last 100 years. It is found that the rainfall variation in northern and southern regions of Kerala is large and the deviation is on different timescales. There is a shifting of rainfall mean and variability during the seasons. The trend analysis on rainfall data over the last 100 years reveals that there is a significant (99%) decreasing trend in most of the regions of Kerala especially in the month of January, July and November. The annual and seasonal trends of rainfall in most regions of Kerala are also found to be decreasing significantly. This decreasing trend may be related to global anomalies as a result of anthropogenic green house gas (GHG) emissions due to increased fossil fuel use, land-use change due to urbanisation and deforestation, proliferation in transportation associated atmospheric pollutants. We have also conducted a study of the seasonality index (SI) and found that only one district in the northern region (Kasaragod) has seasonality index of more than 1 and that the distribution of monthly rainfall in this district is mostly attributed to 1 or 2 months. In rest of the districts, the rainfall is markedly seasonal. The trend in SI reveals that the rainfall distribution in these districts has become asymmetric with changes in rainfall distribution.\n\nHighlights\n•    The rainfall trend and seasonality index is evaluated for Kerala state of India.\n•    The trend is evaluated on a monthly, seasonal and annual timescale.\n•    The rainfall trend is decreasing significantly in almost all regions.\n•    Skewness in rainfall is found in the state by seasonality index test."

    "abstract": "Should you buy organic food? Is it just a status symbol, or is it really better for us? Is it really better for the environment? What about organic produce grown thousands of miles from our kitchens, or on massive corporately owned farms? Is “local” or “small-scale” better, even if it’s not organic? A lot of consumers who would like to do the right thing for their health and the environment are asking such questions.\n\nSapna Thottathil calls on us to rethink the politics of organic food by focusing on what it means for the people who grow and sell it—what it means for their health, the health of their environment, and also their economic and political well-being. Taking readers to the state of Kerala in southern India, she shows us a place where the so-called “Green Revolution” program of hybrid seeds, synthetic fertilizers, and rising pesticide use had failed to reduce hunger while it caused a cascade of economic, medical, and environmental problems. Farmers burdened with huge debts from buying the new seeds and chemicals were committing suicide in troubling numbers. Farm laborers suffered from pesticide poisoning and rising rates of birth defects. A sharp fall in biodiversity worried environmental activists, and everyone was anxious about declining yields of key export crops like black pepper and coffee.\n\nIn their debates about how to solve these problems, farmers, environmentalists, and policymakers drew on Kerala’s history of and continuing commitment to grassroots democracy. In 2010, they took the unprecedented step of enacting a policy that requires all Kerala growers to farm organically by 2020. How this policy came to be and its immediate economic, political, and physical effects on the state’s residents offer lessons for everyone interested in agriculture, the environment, and what to eat for dinner. Kerala’s example shows that when done right, this kind of agriculture can be good for everyone in our global food system."

    "abstract": "The role of sacred forest patches in maintaining biodiversity and offering ecosystem services is well established, though the functional aspects are understated. \n\nThis study aims to understand the functional diversity of tree reproductive traits of sacred forest patches in an altered landscape. Twenty-five sacred groves in Palakkad region, Kerala were chosen to assess the distribution of five reproductive traits – pollination mechanism, fruit size, seed number, seed size and dispersal mechanism – among the tree populations. \n\nThe data matrix was analysed for overall trait-state distribution, functional diversity assessment and its relation to environmental parameters and disturbance in the area. A total of 87 woody species was documented with a fairly homogenized distribution of fruit and seed characters, with ≥50% of the recorded trait states in each grove in comparison to control plot. \n\nPollination and dispersal mechanisms are dominated by a single guild. e.g. insects and birds, often generalist in nature. Functional richness had a strong correlation with Shannon's index and disturbance, but evenness and divergence were weakly related with others. \n\nComparative assessment with null model showed no significant deviations from expected results indicating apparent lack of habitat filtering or resource competition among sacred groves. The trait homogenization and overall simplification of the grove biota is perhaps an outcome of rapid land-use change and its consequences on specialist members. \n\nThis study shows sacred groves are important for maintaining a plethora of functional traits in the altered landscape. However, the prevalence of generalist mediators indicates maintenance of basic ecological functions in the landscape without support for specialist ones."

    "abstract": "This chapter explores a series of personal narratives among migrant settlers situated at the centre of a contested conservation landscape in Kerala, India. Facing starvation and unemployment associated with World War II, impoverished villagers from the plains of Travancore were encouraged by the State to move to its eastern mountain frontier. \n\nThere they faced an impenetrable forest and the unwelcome presence of crop-raiding elephants. Settler remembrances of this period are dominated by articulations about daily elephant raids and by repeated references to famine. \n\nThis study shows that memory born out of collective distress plays an important role in how migrant societies reflect on their lives, construct their identity, respond to exigencies and effect land use change. Alongside an analysis of non-human agency and memory, they serve as invaluable tools in understanding contemporary conflicts around conservation."

This article views Kumily as an important global node where multiple notions of environmentalism and development converge. \n\nBy specifically focusing on the environmental subjecthoods of indigenous youths who work as professional ecotourism guides, the article privileges the cosmopolitanism of the poor as a focal point of understanding social change in India."

    "abstract": "In the light of climate change, the ecosystem services of traditionally maintained shaded Arabica coffee farms become prominent largely for increasing carbon removal. The most important function of the shade-grown coffee agroforestry system is the reduction of the concentration of Carbon in the atmosphere.  It is estimated that one-hectare shade-grown coffee farm with large forest trees can sequester 70–80 tonnes of carbon per hectare, which is more or less equivalent to the carbon stored in an equal area of forest. \n\nA full sun–grown or open coffee in one hectare can only store less than 10 tonnes of carbon. “Monsooned Malabar Arabica Coffee is a specialty coffee of India, sourced from shade coffee plantation and has geographical indication (GI) protection. Shade grown coffee also serves as a refuge for biodiversity and its diverse and complex structure has a high potential to retain biodiversity in the changing climate scenarios.\n\nIn this context, this paper discusses the nexus of coffee, climate and biodiversity and its implications with Wayanad, Kerala, India as a case study. This paper emphasizes the need for promoting sustainable production and consumption of coffee as a carbon neutral brand and promotion of shade grown, biodiversity rich and climate resilient coffee can emerge as a highly valued commodity in the world coffee market. \n\nAttempts at revival of the shade grown coffee system amongst the small growers with appropriate steps in marketing the coffee as a specialty product (carbon neutral and grown in bio-diverse environment) are discussed."

One stream of thought relates to the thematic area of barriers or challenges that adaptation faces. \n\nThis article explores local adaptation trajectories and challenges in a tribal development block in south India. Through the lens of key livelihood strategies pursued in the block – namely income from development interventions, migration and on-farm strategies – it explores the challenges and factors that contribute or have contributed, to impeding successful adaptation outcomes in Attappady. \n\nThe article argues that development interventions (i.e planned adaptations) have not succeeded in addressing structural causes of vulnerability; they have, however, provided an important coping mechanism. \n\nMigration is a socially and culturally differentiated phenomenon and is not a viable diversification option for the most vulnerable population segments in Attappady. Finally, it is found that recent on-farm adaptation strategies present a case of maladaptation that promote marginalisation and are ill-suited to the local ecological and cultural landscape."

The study revealed a developmental trend in the mean total number of correct word scores, number of clusters generated, and switching scores; however, mean cluster size did not show any statistically significant variation. Further, the scores did not vary across genders. Overall, the study indicated a linear developmental trend during verbal fluency with the increase in complexity of strategy use."

Quantitative data were taken from the third round of the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-3) carried out in 2005–06, and qualitative data from one village each in Kerala and Tamil Nadu during 2010–11. The incident rate ratios and thematic analysis showed that among currently married women under the age of 30 years, those who had been sterilized had significantly higher autonomy in household decision-making and freedom of mobility compared with women who had never used any modern family planning method. Early age at sterilization and low fertility enables women to achieve the social status that is generally attained at later stages in the life-cycle. Policies to capitalize on women's autonomy and free time resulting from early sterilization and low fertility should be adopted in south India."

This theme is demonstrated through identified patterns, in the life of the community, of both integration and separation from the wider society. \n\nThe findings highlight the significant role played by cultural influences in the adaptation process and the potential that exists for active learning and the building of bridges to the inner world of migrants."

This fresh and innovative perspective on Jewish merchant activity shows how this list was a component of broader trade connections that developed between the Islamic Mediterranean and South Asia in the Middle Ages. Drawing on a close reading of this unique twelfth-century document, found in the Cairo Genizah and written in India by North African merchant Abraham Ben Yiju, Lambourn focuses on the domestic material culture and foods that structured the daily life of such India traders, on land and at sea. This is an exploration of the motivations and difficulties of maintaining homes away from home, and the compromises that inevitably ensued. Abraham's Luggage demonstrates the potential for writing challenging new histories in the accidental survival of apparently ordinary ephemera."

However, there is evidence to the contrary suggesting that Aśu was a member of a matrilineal household of the Nāyar caste of landlords, and that by allying with her, Ben Yijū was establishing a transregional network in collaboration with hinterland Indian merchants. \n\nIn this paper, I examine the textual evidence from the Cairo Geniza related to the couple and reevaluate it against the anthropological history of Nāyars, especially in relation to their matrilineal inheritance customs and intercaste matrimonial alliances. \n\nArguably, familial alliances such as those of Aśu and Ben Yijū matured into full-fledged communities of Jews, Christians, and Muslims in the region. \n\nA better understanding of the relations between these two individuals, Aśu and Ben Yijū, can shed light on the history of the transregional maritime networks and, consequently, on the history of interreligious relations in the Malayalam-speaking region."

The Cooperative’s raison d’être – as enshrined in its bylaws – is to 'promote the economic interests of the labourers of the Society'. \n\nDespite ups and downs over its 90-year history, the ULCCS is a highly successful cooperative, both in terms of its profitability and in its enhancing the lives of its worker-owners. This, despite the neoliberal policies that have suffocated much economic activity that lies outside of monopoly capitalism's interests. \n\nBuilding Alternatives provides an honest appraisal of a heroic venture of a cooperative enterprise, demonstrating that cooperatives are not only able to survive in a small niche, but are able to grow into substantial institutions within the social life of a region. \n\nThe book does not gloss over the problems that come with this history, providing a rich empirical account that helps us learn from the challenges and successes. The story of ULCCS is not merely an inspiration to the world, but a guidebook to the resilience of cooperatives as alternatives within capitalism."

Despite these advancements in gender equality, intimate partner violence (IPV) against women remains high, with some studies finding increased rates of IPV in Kerala relative to other states. This study examines contributing factors to male-to-female IPV in Kerala. One hundred and thirty-four men were surveyed on perceived marital power, early exposure to violence, drinking habits, depression, and marital satisfaction in relation to current IPV. Forty percent of participants reported incidents of IPV in the past year. Batterers scored significantly higher on childhood abuse, drinking, depression, and marital dissatisfaction. These four predictor variables were all significantly correlated with male-to-female IPV, but perceived marital power was only partially correlated with IPV. Abuse in childhood emerged as the strongest predictor of current IPV. Implications and suggestions for further research are discussed."

It describes the local knowledge systems prevalent among traditional fishworkers in Kerala to predict and forecast coastal hazards. Apart from diverse techniques of participatory inquiry, in-depth interviews were carried out with 400 fishing households across 20 marine fishing villages of the state. The socially constructed nature of coastal hazards is demonstrated as a holistic phenomenon, namely kolu. The empirical knowledge related to forecasting and prediction of kolu is thus explained in terms of biotic, oceanic, atmospheric and celestial spheres. This paper asserts the need for effective community-based early warning systems that are deeply embedded in the livelihood struggles and life-world of marginalised resource-dependent communities."

It is not difficult to identify more such texts that endeavoured to do the same at different stages of the history of the region. The Keralolpathy legend perhaps is the best known among them, according to which the land known as Keralam was recovered from the seas by Lord Parasurama by throwing his axe from Gokarnam (belonging to the state of Karnataka now) to Kanyakumari (in Tamil Nadu at present). The geographical boundaries of the present Kerala State were defined in 1956, when states in India were reorganised, and united Keralam formed. The political boundaries of the state do not correspond well with the imagined Keralams or with the distribution of Malayalam-speaking people. The main disjuncture is Kanyakumari district of Tamil Nadu, which was part of the erstwhile Travancore, with a sizeable number of Malayalam-speaking people. It is doubtful whether political borders ever matched the imagined territory of Keralam. Yet the idea of Keralam is quite old, at least as old as the Mahabali fable. Obviously, the idea of Keralam always had an element that went beyond political boundaries."

    "abstract": "This essay looks at two early texts by a Hindu religious figure, Chattampi Svamikal (1853–1924), from Kerala, the southwestern region of India. Kristumatachhedanam (1890) [A Refutation of Christianity] and Pracina Malayalam (1899) [The Ancient Malayalam Region] draw upon a variety of sources across space and time: the echoes of contemporary debates across India and Empire as much as the detritus of the Enlightenment contest between rationalism and religion in Europe. Does the location of the text in “colonial India” exhaust the space-time of its imagination? The essay argues for a porous rather than a hermetic understanding; the “text” was a supplement to the actual verbal confrontation on street corners and arguments in ephemeral print. The real question is how can historians write postnational histories of thinking? How should we engage with times other than the putatively regnant homogeneous, empty time of empire or nation? I argue that there is an immanent time in texts (arising from the conventions and protocols of the form, the predilections of the thinker, and imagined affinities with ideas coming from other times and places) that exceeds the historical time of the text."

Female boarding schools were established as part of a missionary strategy to forge new identities for convert children and orphans. They were sought to be educated into 'useful women' premised on Christian values of femininity, habits and patterns of work that would mark this transition. However, the schools also became sites of negotiation, resistance and domination. This ruptured the missionary ideas of ´civilization’ and had multiple effects on the social history of the region. By analysing the workings of these boarding establishments, the author seeks to understand the politics and limits of missionary educational provision."

    "abstract": "In 1498, when Vasco da Gama set foot in Kerala looking for Christians and spices, he unleashed a wave of political fury that would topple local powers like a house of cards. The cosmopolitan fabric of a vibrant trading society - with its Jewish and Arab merchants, Chinese pirate heroes and masterful Hindu Zamorins - was ripped apart, heralding an age of violence and bloodshed. One prince, however, emerged triumphant from this descent into chaos. Shrewdly marrying Western arms to Eastern strategy, Martanda Varma consecrated the dominion of Travancore, destined to become one of the most dutiful pillars of the British Raj. What followed was two centuries of internecine conflict in one of India's premier princely states, culminating in a dynastic feud between two sisters battling to steer the fortunes of their house on the eve of Independence. Manu S. Pillai's retelling of this sprawling saga focuses on the remarkable life and work of Sethu Lakshmi Bayi, the last - and forgotten - queen of the House of Travancore. The supporting cast includes the flamboyant painter Raja Ravi Varma and his wrathful wife, scheming matriarchs of 'violent, profligate and sordid' character, wife-swapping court favourites, vigilant English agents, quarrelling consorts and lustful kings. Extensively researched and vividly rendered, The Ivory Throne conjures up a dramatic world of political intrigues and factions, black magic and conspiracies, crafty ceremonies and splendorous temple treasures, all harnessed in a tragic contest for power and authority in the age of empire."

I combine an analysis of in-house research activities by ayurvedic firms in South India with their inter-firm and inter-institutional relations in the establishment of a new innovation regime aiming to promote growth in the ayurvedic sector. The tensions typical of this competitive environment are discussed by paying attention to the absence of contingent regulatory practices and the recent efforts in this direction as illustrated by the use of the ‘Magical Remedies Act’ to curtail the claims of many firms in the market. The ayurvedic pharmaceutical company Oushadhi owned by the Government of Kerala as well as the private firms sna Oushadhasala Pvt. Ltd. and Vaidyaratnam Oushadhasala Pvt. Ltd. (all from Thrissur district of Kerala) are analysed to delineate their research priorities and bottlenecks for innovations. The data of this ayurvedic sector is contrasted with the case of the Kani tribe and the ways in which their traditional knowledge has been reformulated into an industrial ayurvedic product. Through this exploration, the paper attempts to offer an economic explanation for increasing reformulation practices in Ayurveda."

    "abstract": "Garcia d’Orta and Sheikh Zainuddin, from Goa and Malabar, respectively, are different personages in many regards. Fontes (2011) shows that to this day Orta’s work is still discussed from the perspective of the development of pioneering botanical and medical knowledge (see also Lopes 2006). The specific cultural and historical aspects of his works are therefore traditionally neglected. As for Zainuddin, his work seems to be read as an anticolonial Muslim tract ever since it came to light in Portugal through the efforts of the Jewish professor of Arabic at the University of Lisbon, David Lopes (Zinadím 1898). 1 Nonetheless, not only were they contemporaries, but their lives had more than a little in common. For instance, it is clear that Orta and Zainuddin were at the same time near or at the very site of important armed confrontations between Malabar Muslims and the Portuguese, especially a couple of expeditions led by Martim Afonso de Sousa against Calicut on the Malabar Coast, to which Goa was actually intimately connected by sea (as indicated below, Orta was very closely linked to Martim Afonso, his patron since his time in Portugal, and accompanied him in his expeditions). Further down the coast, Cochin, Calicut’s rival, was in fact the first seat of Portuguese power in Asia, before it was transferred to Goa in 1530—hence just a couple of years before Orta’s arrival (Malekandathil 2009, p. 20; for Portuguese attacks against Calicut see for instance Orta 1563, pp. 56–8, Coloquio 15).2"

    "abstract": "We could sum up cosmopolitanism, albeit only imperfectly, as a set of practices and a perspective here coming out of complex connected histories in the Indian Ocean. It implies both a position—for instance, insertion in broad networks of exchange, intellectual and knowledge flows, travel, though it is important to note that none of these in itself seems to be absolutely necessary for cosmopolitanism to arise—as well as a vision of belonging in a common world constructed not in spite of diversity but through it (though, again, this may not be essential). In its most basic and common philosophical expression, cosmopolitanism brings with it a notion or condition of being connected to the world (or a desire to be a world citizen), instead of to a specific place. Cosmopolitanism is also famously a political project in the well-known view of Immanuel Kant, undoubtedly its foremost philosopher in the past two hundred-odd years. We could therefore venture that, however defined, it is both a condition and a project. Different scholars talk about rooted (Cohen 1992; Appiah 2006; Werbner 2008), lived (Gabriel and Ribeiro 2012), discrepant (Clifford 1998), vernacular (Bhabha 1996), working-class (Werbner 1999), subaltern (Sousa Santos 2005), visceral (sic—Nava 2007), and elite (Peterson 2011) cosmopolitanism, or yet the cosmopolitical (Cheah and Robbins 1998)."

    "abstract": "This chapter examines the unique and interlocking dynamics of fertility rituals and practices of different cultural traditions in the Malabar region, on the western coastal area of Kerala, between the sixteenth and the nineteenth centuries. Healing traditions in this region reflected the plurality and interdependence of different cultural frameworks that contributed to the range of medical knowledge in this period. Concepts of illness, including those relating to fertility issues, were constructed through the religious-cultural consciousness of the people. This chapter tries to explore some areas of what may be termed fertility psyche, beliefs and practices, in relation to the binding factors of religion, social functioning, caste institutions, and various concepts such as pollution. Although humor-based healing traditions such as Ayurveda coexisted with magico-spiritual practices, the belief in the supernatural was very predominant in the region. These beliefs created a large complex of rituals and festivals that also created a network of fertility geographies and cults across the Malabar region. These constituted a parallel world of alternative and non-textual fertility healing practices."

This marks a departure from the well-known development trajectory of Kerala – famously known as the Kerala model – of low growth and moderate inequality with high human development indicators. We conduct GDP and growth decomposition, inequality decomposition and a Marxian class analysis of the National Sample Survey data from Kerala in order to understand these recent phenomena. While the notion that economic liberalization adopted by the state and central governments is the main cause of this new state of affairs is generally valid, we provide a more nuanced account of the causal structures based on class analysis and the impact of outward labour migration to the Persian Gulf."

    "abstract": "In recent years there is a growing interest in the phenomenon of across-region marriages and the wellbeing of women in such marriages in female deficit regions in countries such as India and China. Several men in district Namakkal in the south Indian state of Tamil Nadu which has had a long history of daughter elimination are currently experiencing a delay in marriage due to female deficit, educational and occupational incompatibility, and women’s changing marriage preferences, with many bringing brides from outside the region. Women who are priced out of the marriage market in Kerala, a state where women occupy a relatively better status, are also marrying these men. Based on ethnographic fieldwork, this paper argues that the experiences of cross-region brides are not idiosyncratic or ad hoc but are shaped by and embedded within the intersection of caste, class, gender and kinship. In particular the gender contexts in both the place of origin and the place women are married into, affect their wellbeing. While such unions have the potential to create a win-win situation for both parties and challenge practices such as caste endogamy and dowry, they also reinforce unequal gender norms that maintain male privilege."

    "abstract": "The Malabar Rebellion of 1921–1922 is a little studied and poorly known Indian insurgency that deserves wider attention. Not only was it the bloodiest outbreak of disorder in southern India for generations, it also witnessed extensive communal violence against the Hindu population, and was only put down after a series of major operations conducted by the Indian Army. This article re-examines this counter-insurgency campaign and presents a series of conclusions about the level of force used, its effectiveness and the introduction and prosecution of martial law."

    "abstract": "his paper deals with the late eighteenth-century political economy of North Malabar, with focus on the historical aspect of a speculative economic activity, i.e. mercantile surety or the havālāti. Credit money, in its most ubiquitous form of cash advances, was deeply implicated in early modern political practice, both of its kingly and the anti-king verities. The merchants, especially those we find involved in transacting agrarian produce, used it to enhance their economic hold in the country-side by fabricating a convergence with the landholding, locally dominant, peasant proprietorship. The inter-dispensational years witnessed a process of the merchant surety tilting away from the kingly world. The local infrastructure of credit money and its better half, the interest-bearing capital, were successful in creating spontaneous situations of economic dispossession on the one hand and social hierarchies of marketbound commodity on the other. When placed against the historiography of ‘the great (colonial) transformation’, it is found that the economic transition in the region was a slow process till the credit crisis of 1830s."

    "abstract": "Notwithstanding a recent resurgence of scholarly interest in what one may call “Mappila Studies”—the body of scholarship on the Muslims of Malabar in the Malayalam-speaking South Indian state of Kerala—research on this community still leaves too much to be desired. As for the fate of Mappila literary culture within this incipient field of study, scholars have either given short shrift to or painted in broad brushstrokes the impressive literary legacy of the Mappila Muslims of Malabar despite its enormous historic/al and socio-cultural value.2 That said, even the tiny array of scholarly works, mostly by Malayali scholars, that seeks to treat of Mappila literature has largely approached the subject, I argue, from a provincialised “literary” vantage point, thereby reducing the whole of Mappila narratives to mere aesthetic artifacts having no bearing upon the lives of Mappilas. I call this dominant paradigm of doing Mappila literature “literarisation”—that is, fetishising the “literariness” of text by privileging its formal, stylistic, and aesthetic features over its social tone and life. This view assumes text to be a domain of symbols separable from a domain of practice and disregards the social production of text which cannot be abstracted out from the materialities giving shape to it.3"

For the next five years, courts, government officials, and the media debated the significance of this event and what punishment could be levied on the woman who confessed. Had she violated a constitutionally protected ‘essential practice’ of Ayyappan worship? Did it matter that she had claimed to visit Sabarimala before the ban was judicially recognized as an ‘essential practice’? Was she criminally responsible for ‘hurting religious sentiments’ regardless of the sequence of events? Jaimala’s story offers an unprecedented ethnographic window into the birth and development of an ‘essential practice’ in modern Indian jurisprudence."

A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 290 patients, mean age 45 years, 38.2% and 61.8% female. A Malayalam version of the Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness inventory was used for assessing internalised stigma. A multistage random sampling method was adopted. The prevalence of high internalised stigma was higher among patients from community-based care (44.7%) as compared with those from psychiatric hospital–based care (34.1%). Apart from treatment in community-based care, age ≤45 years, unemployment, absence of long-term friendships, no hope of cure with medication, presence of other illnesses, and substance use were significantly associated with high internalised stigma. More than one-third of the subjects had high internalised stigma."

    "abstract": "<i>Modernity of Slavery</i> tells the story of Cherumas, Kuravas, Parayas, Pulayas, and Thanda Pulayas—the slave castes of 19th-century Kerala—and their tryst with Christianity. These castes comprised nearly one-sixth of the population and were 'owned' by upper castes, princely states, and even Europeans.\n \nIn the 19th and 20th centuries, when European missionaries began working among the slave castes, thousands joined the Church. Their generational experiences, struggles, and memories shaped their collective self, and deeply impacted the emergence of Dalit consciousness in Kerala. This book presents and analyses the imaginations and articulations of the notion(s) of equality in the context of caste slavery, missionary activity, and socio-political transition in pre-colonial and modern Kerala.\n \nCentring the questions of consciousness and interiority, this book challenges the stereotypes of historical writing on Dalits and Christianity. It highlights everyday experiences, such as break-up of families, torture, sufferings, and re-memorialization of these experiences by contemporary generations, and weaves in narratives of specific instances, events, and personalities. Offering nuanced and unprecedented use of fresh archival sources and historical ethnography, this book will be a tour de force for anyone interested in the journeys of Dalit consciousness, Christianity, and religious movements in India."

The idea of women's cooperatives came much later, with the earliest ones coming into being only after 1975. This study draws on both primary and secondary data, focusing on the challenges faced by women's cooperative societies (WCSs) in Kottayam District in Southern Kerala. Most women's cooperatives function by limiting their operations to small scale banking activities and enlisting men's participation in various ways. The paper concludes that the scope of empowerment of women through women's cooperatives is severely constrained by the way property rights and gender relations are structured in the state and the manner in which local male politicians have manipulated the societies for partisan ends."

    "tags": "Economics; Land Rights",
    "abstract": "Tenancy originated as a system of land relations from the supply-demand imperfections in land utilisation, which, in many currently developing countries, has a strong linkage with their age-old social and economic inequities. For the people whose only means of livelihood is land, right to land is guaranteed through the provisions for right to life enshrined in the Article 3 of the UN Declaration of human rights (1948) and Article 21 of the Indian Constitution. Land in India, as in many developing countries, is the largest asset of private possession and is still the largest resource for generation of sustainable income, for a majority of its population. However, a vast proportion of it is entitled to a few who acquired its possession by birth, or coercion or royal grants, and they never identified with the production systems of their land by deploying their physical labour directly. In most cases, they resorted to leave the land for cultivation by tenants who included sharecroppers. This resulted not only in poor yield of the land, owing mainly to the pareto-inefficient allocation of labour, but also high social tension, as those who toiled on the land remained landless and were forced to work hard on others’ land for a meagre share of the marginal product of their labour.\n\nLand use in Kerala -- a state formed in 1956 by amalgamating two principalities and a portion of the erstwhile British province -- has a chequered history. Some measures of land reforms were already initiated by the rulers of the erstwhile principalities. Yet the state inherited a society of abject inequality in land distribution, and it was the highest among the major states in India. By the time Kerala was made a federal entity in the Indian Union, the demand by the common man for more stakes in land, merited very high social sensibility and collective indignation. However, the much acclaimed Agrarian Relations Bill 1957, and their later variants that have been finally implemented in Kerala by governments of both hues – the communist-led or the Congress-led – have reportedly failed to arrest the concentration of land with a few who have had no inclination to agriculture either as a land-based economic activity, or as the sole engine for the food security of the country, making the poor, whose livelihood still is bound by the land, alienated from this inelastic natural resource."

    "abstract": "The quality of life that a person leads depends critically on where it is led. Even taking into account levels of economic development, the chances of an individual surviving through infancy, growing up literate, or living a healthy, long life vary dramatically across regions of the world, in different countries, and within the same country. What are the causes of such variation in wellbeing? This article points to a factor that has been virtually ignored in the vast scholarship on social welfare and development—the solidarity that emerges from a sense of shared identity. The argument marks an important departure from the traditional emphasis on the role of class and electoral politics, as well as from the dominant view of the negative implications of identity for welfare. Combining statistical analyses of all Indian states and a comparative historical analysis of two Indian provinces, Kerala and Uttar Pradesh, this article demonstrates how the strength of attachment to the subnational political community—subnationalism—can drive a progressive social policy and improve developmental outcomes."

What do these disputes mean to those affected? How do the narratives of indigenous people, legal professionals, and the media intersect? In this richly layered and nuanced account, Pooja Parmar focuses on indigeneity in the widely publicized controversy over a Coca-Cola bottling facility in Kerala, India. Juxtaposing popular, legal, and Adivasi narratives, Parmar examines how meanings are gained and lost through translation of complex claims into the languages of social movements and formal legal systems. Included are perspectives of the diverse range of actors involved, based on interviews with members of Adivasi communities, social activists, bureaucrats, politicians, lawyers, and judges. Presented in clear, accessible prose, Parmar's account of translation enriches debates in the fields of legal pluralism, indigeneity, and development.\n\n    The first major study to focus on indigeneity in the widely covered dispute over a Coca-Cola facility in Kerala, India\n    Takes an interdisciplinary approach combining law, history, anthropology, and translation studies\n    Includes analysis of litigation currently pending before the Supreme Court of India"

Publicized as a Malayalam edition of Bigg Boss, it soon ran into controversy with the filing of the injunction at the Bombay High Court by Endemol group, the makers of Bigg Boss who alleged copyright infringement. This was followed by protests by women's organizations and an outcry for television censorship. The making and the telecast would leave the participants and the producers at loggerheads about the unsaid norms which govern the so called “appropriate” content to be telecast during the prime time. Using an ethnographic lens, I map out the varied circuits taken by the television program and the “afterlives” of the participants, to explore the social dynamics that shaped the debates in the post-telecast phase. In doing so, I try and see how rather than a mere deployment of “electronic eyes” and voyeuristic gaze, Malayalee House was an attempt to push the limits of tolerance that Malayali society would have towards the open expression of intimacy and sexuality."

It draws upon local histories of these two places which trace the intertwined histories of land, politics, domestic life, and work since the early-mid-20th century. The slum emerged as individuals from different communities and faiths collected there and set up homes and families but did not automatically generate social bonds that transcended individual interests. In sharp contrast, in the fishing hamlet, contrary to the widespread belief that collective empowerment of the poor, civil and political, requires a breaking down of caste-community identities, the resistance to exploitation and dispossession was and is rooted in invocations of the “community” even as several fisher castes organised around the worker identity."

This study explicates the capability notion, which incorporates the question of what is of value for the subject, by examining how much some of the major concerns of development matter for the poor as revealed from their perceptions and pursuits. The study specifically examines how detested are some of the widely negatively valued situations (unfreedoms—their being disadvantaged in an unequal world and their being employed in lower-end jobs) and how valued are some of the widely positively valued functionings (freedoms—education for upward mobility) in the lives of the poor. The findings give a nuanced and multilayered understanding of the capability notion. It reveals how, with regard to negatively evaluated unfreedoms, the subject need not necessarily evaluate them negatively. This is not just because of adaptive preferences but also due to the fact that there is “multiplicity of functionings even within unfreedoms,” some of which are positive and the subject might value them positively and even passionately. With regard to positively evaluated freedoms, the subject might not prioritize them in the gamut of other goals and pursuits."

    "abstract": "The link between e-governance and development has been widely leveraged for policy formulation in India, however, little is known about its application to food security. This paper fills the gap with a study of Kerala, where the Public Distribution System (PDS), the main national food security programme, has been digitalised in its main functions. Findings reveal that the digital programme has been purposefully devised to combat the problem of diversion (“rice mafia”) of PDS goods to the market: however, issues of partial coverage and mistargeting remain. Lessons are drawn for other states computerising the PDS and their social safety nets."

    "abstract": "Measles outbreaks continue to occur in developing countries. This study attempted to explore the context of an outbreak of measles in a community of predominantly fishermen in Kerala to find out whether the outbreak was the result of a failure to vaccinate or failure of the vaccine itself. A cross sectional study was conducted in Mukkola village of Thiruvananthapuram district, Kerala, India. A total of 215 children of ages between 9 and 35 months were studied. Documented evidence of measles vaccination was available only in 71.6% (65.57–77.62) of the children. The risk factors for not being immunized against measles were being third or higher in birth order and having: a father whose occupation is fishing, low family income, lower parental education, Muslim religion and poor knowledge regarding measles and its vaccine. Of the 215 children studied, 43 had a history of measles. Thirty percent of these 43 children were younger than the age of vaccination. Unvaccinated children, children third or higher in birth order and children of families with more than 5 members had a significantly higher risk of contracting measles. Vaccine effectiveness was 76.6% (95% CI: 75.96–77.99). The prevalence of missed vaccination opportunities was found to be 15.8% (34/215). Even with the relatively low vaccine effectiveness, this outbreak could have been prevented by higher vaccination coverage. Lowering the age at administration of the first dose of measles vaccine needs to be considered. Effective utilization of opportunities for vaccination could enhance coverage and prevent outbreaks in the future."

If Arabic’s linguistic imprint across the Indian Ocean is undeniable, Indic people and their languages were equally influential and the eastwards movement of Indic words into the languages of maritime Southeast Asia is well attested. However, the present research seeks to complicate this picture further by highlighting the lesser studied westwards movement of Indic words into Arabic. Focusing on the adoption of two Indic loanwords into twelfth century Judaeo-Arabic, the article identifies the Malayalam and Tulu common nouns from which the terms tālam and fātiya derive, and then proceeds to examine the wider history of their journey into the western Indian Ocean, ending in the thirteenth century Nile Delta."

As much of his work has been on the history of Kerala, the bulk of writing here is on the history and culture of that state. He has, however, made lasting contributions to other areas of Indian history and epigraphy and hence, another section of this volume is devoted to epigraphy and connected history. With contributions from Christophe Vielle, K.N. Ganesh, Manu V. Devadevan, Heike Moser, Rich Freeman, Krishna Mohan Shrimali, Daud Ali, Bhairabi Prasad Sahu, Upinder Singh, Elizabeth Lambourn, Noboru Karashima, Y. Subbarayalu, Venkata Raghotham and Nayanjot Lahiri, this volume is not merely a homage to a truly path-breaking academic; but it is also a monument to the influential nature of Professor Narayanan’s work. The volume contains articles on the history and culture of Kerala, epigraphy, anthropological analysis of temple festivals, caste, money trade, etc.\nThis volume will be useful for students of Kerala history and those who seek to understand the nuances that have shaped what is today called ‘God’s Own Country’."

Every Five Year Plan documents in Kerala repeatedly states that there would be a thorough revamping of all on-going schemes and institutions, but no significant changes have taken place despite rapid changes in the socio-economic condition. For example, during the last four decades the contribution of agricultural sector in the Gross Domestic Product of Kerala declined from 40 percent to 10 per cent. Yet even now nearly40 per cent of the statistical personnelin the state are engaged in the collection of agricultural statistics. Therefore, the State Government and the State Planning Board have to take urgent steps to re-organise the statistical system in the state to build up data base at local government level and for their aggregation at block, district and state levels."

    "abstract": "The mainstream theories on development try to understand the empowerment of women through select indicators relating to education and health. Kerala provides a suitable setting to understand how far higher levels of literacy, enrolment in higher education, favourable sex ratio, small family, and access to health care facilities translate into empowerment of women defined in terms of their role in decisionmaking within a household and freedom of physical mobility. Our findings based on the micro-level study of a village in Kerala reveal that remarkable achievements measured by conventional indicators have failed to elevate women from their subordinate status within a household. The analysis of Kudumbashree, a state-sponsored woman-centric poverty alleviation programme, also reveals that women’s access to community programmes has failed to empower them. Such an apparent paradox is explained through a complex process of gendering at three levels: education, employment and access to economic resources. Social norms, the dowry system, the patrilineal system of inheritance and patrilocal residence also affect such a gendering process. The choices that a woman/household makes regarding her education, activity pattern and community participation are very much shaped by a gendered social structure where a man is associated with ‘outside activity’ and woman with ‘inside activity’."

Over the last two decades, the KMS has provided estimates of emigration, return emigration, out-migration, return out-migration, remittances and average cost of migration. In 1998, the estimated emigrants from Kerala was 1.36 million, increased to 1.84 million in 2003 (absolute increase of 0.48 million during the two survey periods), increased to 2.19 million in 2008 (with decline to the additional increase to 0.35 million in the inter-survey period) and increased to 2.40 million in 2014 (increased of 0.21 million). However, for the first time, KMS 2016 not only estimated the emigrants from Kerala to decline from 2.40 million in 2014 to 2.28 million in 2016 (absolute decline of 0.22 million) but also reach the level of KMS 2011, which estimated the emigrants at 2.28 million. In view of the decline in emigrants, remittances are expected to decline by 10 per cent during 2014–2016."

    "abstract": "The states of Punjab and Kerala both have a long and continuing history of significant overseas emigration. Drawing upon original research, this chapter examines the extent to which the relationship between overseas migration and regional development is inclusive within these states, with particular reference to caste inequities. The authors investigate the role of Dalits within the international migration-development nexus within two regions where overseas migration is increasingly heralded as one of the main facilitators of social mobility, economic growth and regional development. The authors compare Punjab, which has witnessed significant Scheduled Caste overseas migration, including to Western societies, with Kerala, where international Dalit emigration has been insignificant, particularly to the Global North. The authors argue that the very small number of Keralan Dalit migrants overseas means a negligible relationship between Dalit migration and challenges to caste inequality there. However, even within Punjab, which has seen relatively high Dalit international migration, any concrete evidence of significant impact upon existing caste inequalities is limited. The authors’ argument supports those who have started to challenge previously dominant and celebratory discourses on the migration-development nexus by questioning an assumed positive impact of ‘transnationalism from below’ upon sending regions. However, this chapter is the first to undertake such critical questioning of Dalit transnationalism, which is often taken as automatically progressive in challenging inequalities."

    "abstract": "Capital-labour dynamics remains the most intriguing relationship in any workplace. The economic reforms in the early 1990s in India have had a direct impact on production and distribution networks in the gold industry. The changes in the production regime are associated with the expansion of local markets and the integration of the Indian economy with the world economy. These changes forced a restructuring of the labour market. The traditional caste-based occupation has altered, resulting in minute specialization and division of labour. When the organization of work changed, migrant workers became crucial inputs, who provided capital with a readily available reserve of labour. Their entry is facilitated through the operation of an institutional mechanism and a set of intermediaries, who actively segment the labour market. Deregulation, heightened competition and inflow of massive investment into the industry led to a demand for more workers. As a result, the industry witnessed an increasing use of migrants, women and children as workers. The employment of such a heterogeneous group of workers has resulted in conflicting relations between capital and labour on the shop floor. The pattern of migration into the gold jewellery-making industry of Kerala shows that about 80 per cent of the migrants are from the northern and western parts of the country. This has complicated the existing antagonistic relations between labour and capital on the shop floor. Given such an economic situation, the socio-cultural significance of gold, the remittance-fuelled Kerala economy and the increasing intensity and scale of gold jewellery retailing within the state have prompted an interesting exploration of the working of the industry."

Therefore, the parties are compelled to keep away from hard secularism to adopt soft communalism in electioneering and policymaking.\n\nThis chapter shows how this community-based pressure politics works in Kerala’s bipolar coalition system.\n\nThe central argument of the chapter is that both the coalitions, despite their modern, secular ideologies, actually perform the function of gatekeepers and carriers of religious as well as communal forces in politics."

    "abstract": "This work challenges the general perception that mass media fails to communicate scientific studies and research to the general public.\n\nScience communication, once the exclusive preserve of a scientific elite, has not been immune to the growing influence of mass media over society. As mass media becomes the most prominent site of public deliberation over science, multiple voices — both expert and non-expert — have begun to emerge, rewriting the social contract of science.\n\nThrough detailed case studies of journalistic presentation of science news in regional newspapers in Kerala (that includes public debates on earthquakes, Mullaperiyar dam, well-collapses, coloured rain, and the controversial clinical trials at the Regional Cancer Centre (RCC), Thiruvananthapuram), the book demonstrates that mass media has a rather complex relationship with science in contemporary democracies. The social dynamics of their mutual resonance and its impact on public engagement with science is the key emphasis of the book.\n\nSince the 1990s, the Indian state of Kerala has been witnessing a large number of scientific controversies being discussed in the regional newspapers. Set against the backdrop of these public controversies, <i>Contested Knowledge</i> explores how these mediated disputes brought the otherwise hidden dynamics of scientific knowledge production into full public view.\n\nThe book contends that this new mode of public engagement with science radically differs from its earlier form nurtured by the Kerala Sasthra Sahithya Parishad (KSSP), the largest people’s science movement in India. It explores critical questions about ‘medialized science’ such as: What is a scientific-citizenry? How did a ‘scientific public sphere’ develop in Kerala? How does public contestation of knowledge contribute deliberative democracy by re-instilling politics into science? What is the role of ‘experts’ in this new phase of public engagement with science? Are there limits to such a democratization of science? Who are excluded from this process? What are its implications for democratization itself?"

    "abstract": "The various metanarratives of globalization project hyper-mobile capital as the leading factor for global economic integration, ignoring the role of labour. Questioning this paradigm, this book reasons that labour becomes actively involved in the very process of globalization and capital expansion. Based on the broad theme of globalization and labour, particularly female labour, the author applies the ‘labour geography’ approach to examine contemporary forms of labour control, conflict, and response under a globalization regime in Kerala through four diverse and in-depth empirical case studies set in this state. The geographic perspective sheds light on local variability and uneven development in labour market, helping chart the complex landscapes within which contemporary workers live, work, and struggle. In view of dramatic changes in the labour scenario in Kerala over the second half of the twentieth century, this book constructs a collage of trends in Kerala’s labour scene, in an analysis that departs from economic orthodoxy and borrows from sociological, anthropological, and partly ethnographic approaches to highlight the role played by seemingly unlikely actors in the process of globalization."

Seafarers and writers have described it in terms of its own cultural and social life; however, a complete historical description of the engagement of the Arabs, Persians, Portuguese, Dutch, French, and British has still not been attempted. Unlike the existing studies that rely heavily on European sources, Malabar in the Indian Ocean calls the attention of researchers to the rich trove of unknown or underutilized indigenous and foreign source materials in different languages, such as Malayalam, Arabic, Persian, Hebrew, and Latin. In addition, it highlights certain materials that bear archaeological, epigraphical, and architectural significance. Looking beyond the economics of the region and using translations of unpublished and rare sources, this volume highlights how the ocean has left a deep impact on the region’s society, culture, religion, and politics, making it an exemplary cosmopolitan place."

    "abstract": "We critically discuss the impact of sustainable development initiatives in Kerala on biodiversity and on women farmers in the matrilineal Adivasi community of the Kurichya tribe in Wayanad. \n\nBy contextualising development programmes regarding the specifically gendered access to land, division of labour, distribution of knowledge, and decision-making power, we situate our analysis within the theoretical framework of feminist political ecology.\n\nWe first outline women’s gaining of social and political space in local self-government institutions (panchayath) and then critically discuss the impacts of women’s farming groups (Joint Liability Groups: JLGs).\n\nDecentralisation and development programmes have aimed at empowering women and reducing poverty through improved food security. However, little success has materialised, as patriarchal power structures concerning decision-making processes as well as control over the most valuable resources (land and rice) and traditional knowledge have been maintained.\n\nWhereas women’s self-help groups (Kudumbasree) in Kerala have enhanced their position, women’s farming groups (JLGs), by contrast, have brought little betterment. In some cases they have even downsized women’s management and knowledge of resources related to agriculture and do not integrate or enhance Kurichya women’s knowledge. \n\nAs some women are now introducing high-yielding rice seeds and fertiliser, and as it is impossible for them to control land and get access to traditional rice seeds — the domain of men — we contest the notion of women being considered the preservers of agrobiodiversity.\n\nWe argue, rather, that the construction and transformation of ecological traditional knowledge is highly dependent on the gendered multi-scaled power structures of state and community."

To date, there have been no studies on the prevalence of gambling among senior high school and higher secondary school students in India.\n\nThis study reports point prevalence of gambling and its psychosocial correlates among high school students in Kerala. 5043 high school students in the age group 15–19 years, from 73 schools, were selected by cluster random sampling from the district of Ernakulam, Kerala, South India.\n\nThey completed questionnaires that assessed gambling, substance use, psychological distress, suicidality, and symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).\n\nOf a total of 4989 completed questionnaires, 1400 (27.9 %) high school students reported to have ever gambled and 353 (7.1 %) were problem gamblers. Of those who had ever gambled, 25.2 % were problem gamblers. Sports betting (betting on cricket and football) was the most popular form of gambling followed by the lottery.\n\nProblem gamblers when compared with non-problem gamblers and non-gamblers were significantly more likely to be male, have academic failures, have higher rates of lifetime alcohol and tobacco use, psychological distress, suicidality, history of sexual abuse and higher ADHD symptom scores.\n\nGambling among adolescents in India deserves greater attention, as one in four students who ever gambled was a problem gambler and because of its association with a range of psychosocial variables."

    "abstract": "This essay argues that the current crisis of feminism in Kerala State, India, has little to do with the hegemony of English. Rather, the difficulty arises partly from the difficulties that feminists encounter in translating feminism between different linguistic layers and partly from local feminism’s relative inability to generate an effective counterlanguage to the depoliticising vocabulary of gender mainstreaming found in governmentalised feminism. I argue for greater attention to the manner in which feminist political ideas get translated on the ground and to the translation of feminist literary writing, which is currently a very powerful presence in the Malayalam (the dominant language here) public sphere, as ways of generating a politically effective feminist idiom and refurbishing feminist thought and politics for Malayali society. Instead, I suggest that part of the crisis in feminism here comes from difficulty in translating between different layers of Malayalam—between high-intellectual Malayalam and its everyday variant."

    "abstract": "This article addresses an older debate which held that the agricultural transformation in the regional economy of Kerala has been mainly driven by ‘peasant rationality’. It is argued in this article that the agrarian transformation driven by peasant rationality has created a dichotomous agrarian society in the state, with a genre of rich farmers who have significantly benefited by the ‘rational’ switch over to commercial agriculture and another segment of subsistence farmers who have been marginalised by the agricultural development process. The article argues that the agricultural development process driven by ‘peasant rationality’ has several ramifications for the sustainable future of Kerala’s agricultural economy. To substantiate this, the article critically examines the agricultural development experience of the state over the past six decades and brings out the impasse affecting the agricultural sector in the emerging context of growing market uncertainties and other challenges confronting the agro-ecosystems and natural environments."

    "abstract": "The article analyses the labour process in the gold jewellery-making industry in Kerala, particularly focusing on a single dimension “skill.” Informal manufacturing has emerged as a substantial income and employment-generating activity in the post-liberalisation (1990s) period in the country. This was accompanied by the accentuating internal migration throughout India aided by strong social networks and commissioned agents. The gold jewellery-making in Kerala, like in other parts of India, was organised on caste lines up to the 1960s, dominated by the Viswakarma caste. Work was carried out in response to local orders by a single craftsman, assisted by an apprentice. The burgeoning market economy and the enforcement of deregulation had profound effects on the production relations, hierarchy, and organisation in the industry. The deregulation of the gold industry ushered in different kinds of workers into the industry. The core of the article is an examination of the variety of skill requirements in the industry and the position and place of workers—local workers, women workers, and migrants in the industry."

    "abstract": "This book offers an innovative examination of how 'low-technology' industries operate. Based on extensive fieldwork in India, the book fuses economic and sociological perspectives on information sharing by means of informal interaction in a low-technology cluster in a developing country. In doing so, the book sheds new light on settings where economic relations arise as emergent properties of social relations.\n\nThis book examines industrial innovation and microeconomic network behaviour among producers and clusters, perceiving knowledge diffusion to be a socially-spatial, as much as a geographically spatial, phenomenon. This is achieved by employing two methods - simulation modelling, and (quantitative, qualitative, and historical) social network analysis. The simulation model, based on its findings, motivates two empirical studies - one descriptive case and one network study - of low-tech rural and semi-urban traditional technology clusters in Kerala state in southern India. These cases demonstrate two contrasting stories of how social cohesion either supports or thwarts informal information sharing and learning.\n\nThis book pushes towards an economic-sociology approach to understanding knowledge diffusion and technological learning, which perceives innovation and learning as being more social processes than the mainstream view perceives them to be. In doing so, it makes a significant contribution to the literature on defensive innovation and the role of networks in technological innovation and knowledge diffusion, as well as to policy studies of Indian small firm and traditional technology clusters."

Answering ‘no’ to this question, the chapter seeks to show how gender and religion were mediated by contests over sovereignty, at a conceptual and political level. I examine a colonial context, the British takeover of Malabar in southern India, wherein the new claimants to rule challenged in new ways the power of a saintly Arab Muslim family representing in itself a transoceanic expansion. Through a case of conversion trouble, I demonstrate the appearance of gender in a relationship to religion that was at once historically specific and theoretically general."

    "abstract": "Religious accessions and conversions have spawned a great deal of scholarly attention from various academic disciplines. Conversion to Christianity is defined within the social, cultural, political and philosophical contexts, and suggests that it is a consequence of persuasion, cognitive act, commitment of a free will or a change from one view to another. But the main difficulty with such arguments is that they often tend to ignore the distinct historical experiences of the converts, because the explanations offered for the relatively increased number of Christians among the economically-challenged communities during the study period largely centred around factors which were ‘outside’ the missionary politics. The converts’ poor and denigrated economic conditions due to natural calamities and other reasons seemed to be chiefly responsible for the origin of the much-celebrated and much-maligned ‘rice Christians’ in the southern part of the subcontinent. From a pecuniary standpoint, the economics of conversion became a much-preferred option among the Protestant converts rather than their religiosity per se or the content of their religious belief. Therefore, the ways in which the idea of rice Christians emerged, studied and interpreted are worth a critical enquiry. This article argues that missionary Christianity as developed in colonial south India among both the affluent as well as the disadvantaged sections of the society had also created a parallel, monolithic and unclassified rice Christian class within the broader Christian discourse both in theory and practice and that they are distinctly different in terms of their socio-cultural and political as well as economic conditions elsewhere in the country."

It shows that formal adaptation strategies are highly techno-centric, costly, and do not take into account the vulnerabilities of the fishing community. Instead, they have contributed to ecological, livelihood, and knowledge uncertainties. The adaptation strategies of the fishing community are a response to these uncertainties. However, they may not lead to the fishing community's recovery from its vulnerability contexts. This case study is primarily qualitative in nature. Data were collected through in-depth interviews. Insights reveal that when actors with diverse values, interests, knowledge, and power evolve or design their respective adaptation strategies, the resulting interface often aggravates existing uncertainties associated with hazards. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that local discourses on coastal hazards are livelihood-centric and socially constructed within the struggle of the fishing community to access resources and to acquire the right to development."

He became one of India’s greatest constitutional lawyers, a passionate general secretary of the Indian National Congress, a loyal dewan of the princely state of Travancore and vice-chancellor of two different universities simultaneously. In the midst of a lecturing tour at universities in London and Oxford in 1966, C.P. breathed his last.\n\nInheriting an immense fortune through his mother, and an iron resolve to pursue academic excellence from his father, C.P. was the ‘prize boy’ at school and college, and he quickly rose to become a top lawyer at the Madras bar. He also became the youngest advocate-general of Madras. His undying zeal took him to the governor’s executive council, the viceroy’s executive council and the League of Nations. And as he advised the maharaja of Travancore through political intrigues, he grew unpopular and narrowly escaped an assassination attempt.\n\nThis biographer presents C.P.’s life through the diligent execution of his duties; an obedient son, a nurturing senior lawyer, a lieutenant in the Besantine Congress faction, an administrator dedicated to nation building and social reform, and an academic in relentless pursuit of intellectual excellence. We are shown a man who inherits the will to prove the stars wrong and script his own destiny, establishing a legacy in legal, political and academic worlds. And this glory—with its accompanying very human failings—has been told with an elegance that is too charming to miss.\n\nDuty, Destiny and Glory will interest students of biography, modern Indian history and political science, as well as the general reader."

Production relations may become socially embedded and may exhibit homophily. We work towards understanding an embeddedness–homophily connection with the support of a case study of the decline of a formerly dominant handloom weavers' community in Kerala, the Saliyars. We demonstrate that there is a spectrum of cohesion along which network links can be categorised, and that it is homophilous-embeddedness that truly defines cohesion. We build the evidence that the Saliyars' networks were characterised by ‘homophilous-embeddedness’, which, we show, has been relayed across generations. Due to this attribute, the Saliyars are placed as an example that counters the standard line in the literature that community cohesion has been historically congruent to technological progress and knowledge diffusion in handloom in India."

    "abstract": "Is there a strong correlation between caste and class in access to education, especially higher education? This is the broader question addressed by the study in the context of Kerala. Micro-level insights based on the study of a village in Kerala show that old forms of inequalities have been replaced by new forms of inequalities in education. Notwithstanding Kerala’s impressive indicators, huge inequalities exist in the educational attainments of the population. The Scheduled Castes (SCs) are still at the bottom of the rankings in enrolment in higher education despite the adoption of a positive discrimination policy and educational subsidy by the state. This situation is explained through an examination of three issues: the perception of the lower employment potential of conventional or mainstream higher education, the educational polices of the state, and disparate access to economic resources. The study concludes by offering a few policy recommendations to make higher education more inclusive for marginalised sections of society."

    "abstract": "Following the police raid on the ‘Muthanga’ land occupation by Adivasi (‘indigenous’) activists in Kerala, India, in February 2003, intense public debate erupted about the fate of Adivasis in this ‘model’ development state. Most commentators saw the land occupation either as the fight-back of Adivasis against their age-old colonisation or the work of ‘external’ agitators. Capitalist restructuring and ‘globalisation’ was generally seen as simply the latest chapter in the suffering of these Adivasis. Little focused attention was paid to the recent class trajectory of their lives under changing capitalist relations, the exact social processes under which they were having to make a living, and what had only recently—and still largely ambiguously—made them ready to identify themselves politically as ‘Adivasi’. Demonstrating the usefulness of ethnographic curiosity driven by an ‘expanded’ class analysis, as elaborated in Marxian anthropology, this article provides an alternative to the liberal-culturalist explanation of indigenism in Kerala. It argues instead that contemporary class processes—as experienced close to the skin by the people who decided to participate in the Muthanga struggle—were what shaped their decision to embrace indigenism."

    "abstract": "Drawing on the struggles of the Nitta Gelatin India Limited Action Council at Kathikudam in Kerala, this article critically expands on Guy Standing's notion of the global precariat. Using feminist work on the politics of waste, it argues that gendered precariousness is produced through human-as-waste conditions besides underscoring the importance of understanding it as a lived and felt process of precarity-in-the-making. This process not only shapes gendered experiences of precariousness wrought by environmental degradation but also informs sociopolitical struggles against precariousness and for social memory and belonging. It argues that these spaces of political struggle often also produce gendered contradictions and specific gendered divisions of labour within their political praxis."

    "abstract": "Thangals are an endogamous community in Kerala, India, of Yemeni heritage who claim direct descent from the Prophet Muhammad’s family. Due to their sacrosanct status, many thangals work as religious healers and thus are part of the informal mental health care system in Northern Kerala. Using the case of one thangal healer as an illustration of the many ritual healers in Kerala who engage the modern discourse of psychology in their practices, I argue that the psychologisation of ritual healing is part of a wider trend: the increasing rationalisation and scientification of traditional medical practices, whereby an increasing number of traditional healers negotiate science, modernity and religion and position their practice within these contested fields. Based on the analysis of this thangal’s healing practice in the local context of Northern Kerala, I further argue that in order to understand “ritual” healing, scholars should emphasise pragmatic realism more than doctrinal purity."

Ours is a teaching hospital catering to patients in the northern districts of Kerala and has a de-addiction ward and OPD services running for more than 10 years. In this context we thought of doing an analysis of the patients getting inpatient care at this center for alcohol dependence syndrome (ADS).  Case records of all patients admitted with ADS in 2012 were recalled from the records library and information gathered based on the data sheet prepared which covered the relevant demographic and clinical variables and the details of treatments(s) offered during the stay. Results: All were males. 96.7% of the sample had >10 years of alcohol use. 76.6% had less than 10th standard education. 75.6% were married. 96.7% were from the ‘BPL ‘category. 54.4% had delirium; 37.8% had seizures and. Lorazepam was the commonly used detoxification agent. 72.2% had positive family history. This study helped in finding out the profile of patients seeking care for ADS at a tertiary care center and to identify lacunae in existing services."

    "abstract": "Interest in psychological empowerment and employee engagement has increased substantially over the last decade among practitioners and academicians. However they have emerged independent of each other with little diligence as to how they are associated. The study attempts to predict employee engagement through dimensions of psychological empowerment. This article will contribute to our understanding of the relationship between psychological empowerment and employee engagement. The study is based on primary data collected from 101 employees working in three service organisations in central Kerala. Statistical techniques like correlation and multiple regression analysis were employed to measure the significance and strength of relationship between psychological empowerment and its dimensions (meaning, competence, self-determination and impact) and employee engagement. Correlation analysis revealed a significant positive association between psychological empowerment and employee engagement. Further analysis showed that all the dimensions of psychological empowerment, other than self-determination are predictors of employee engagement. Findings of the study are discussed, together with limitations and suggestions for future research."

    "abstract": "This article reports on the social strategy use among Malayalee undergraduate students across eight university colleges in one university in Kerala. The investigation examines social strategy use in three main language learning contexts (in class, on campus outside the classroom, and off campus) and explores the topic from structuralist and sociocultural perspectives. The study also investigates the interplay of stakeholders' desires and opportunities in conversational contexts, in which individuals and groups deployed social strategies and yet experienced their sociocultural positions being challenged. Data were collected through interviews and the Social Strategy Inventory for Language Learning (SSILL), a questionnaire that was built on but expanded beyond the social strategies in Oxford's (1990) Strategy Inventory for Language Learning (SILL). Results indicate that although participating Malayalee undergraduate students seem highly motivated and fairly cooperative, they settled for less than optimal use of interactive social strategies, probably because their legitimate right to become proficient speakers of English continued to be hampered by language education policies. The situation is far more pervasive than what several previous studies of language learning strategies (LLS) had envisaged. These findings imply that there is an urgent need to socialize and acculturate the less proficient Malayalee students into English-speaking groups to make their transition from schools to colleges smoother and to give them more autonomy."

A geographical explanation of the formation of such gendered spaces under home-based production is presented, following which everyday labour relations and the framing of workers' response strategies, which brought capital and labour to the negotiating table, are illustrated."

There were gendered, community-based, official, unofficial, and popular ideas about children in the context of marriage and out of the competing official discourses on gender and modernity in Travancore, the one related to Christianity eventually became dominant. It presents the layers of discourses related to gender and child marriage: an official one in census reports, another in mid-level legal discussions, and a third more popular view. It discusses official presentations about gender relations as found in census reports in which concepts of modernity and civilisation are crucial and also an account of debates in the Travancore Legislative Council about child marriage in the 1930s. It also reviews a large number of cases involving dialogues between citizens and civil servants."

    "abstract": "Homestead farming, prevalent in different parts of the world, presents an excellent example of the many systems and practices of agroforestry. The homestead is an operational farm unit in which a number of crops (including tree crops) are grown, along with rearing of livestock, poultry or fish, mainly for the purpose of meeting the farmer's basic needs. Homesteads or home gardens, with special reference to Kerala, have been enumerated and their key characteristics summarised in this paper. Homestead farming satisfies the requirements of sustainability by being productive, ecologically sound, stable, economically viable, and socially acceptable. However, landuse changes, availability of agricultural labour, and falling commodity prices are major constraints in homestead farming in Kerala. Future strategies to improve homestead farming should aim at watershed-based development with focus on a whole-farm or systems approach; restructuring and refining existing home gardens, and developing sustainable models through a farmer-participatory approach for each agro-ecological zone; forming homestead clusters; creating germplasm registers; bridging the yield gap by improving crop productivity; developing post-harvest technology of home garden products; generating non-farm employment opportunities; promoting and improving rural financial networks; providing essential rural infrastructure; creating coalitions to address policy concerns at all levels; and broadening consumer perspectives."

The present paper focuses on the food security concerns in the state, which produces less than a quarter of its food grain requirements. There has however been a misguided optimism regarding the state's food security status in the recent times owing to the state's better economic performance, the supposed effective functioning of the Public Distribution System and good performance in terms of health outcome indicators. The paper critically analyses each of these factors and reveals the factual position behind the unwarranted optimism."

    "abstract": "Conventional wisdom holds that although at the time of Kerala state formation in 1956 the northern region (Malabar) lagged behind the southern region (Travancore-Cochin) in development indicators, inter-regional disparities reduced considerably in ensuing decades. The reduction in regional disparities is typically attributed to modern Kerala’s welfare policy regime, which emphasized greater growth of infrastructure facilities in Malabar. This study presents evidence for health that suggests that while disparities in outcomes reduced over time, disparities in key infrastructural inputs did not reduce. These differing trends for infrastructure and outcomes are consistent with a diminishing returns argument that may have little to do directly with the Kerala regime. Rather, the potency of the Kerala regime lay in its ability to increase development inputs throughout the state (albeit without favoring the lagging region) and consolidate the conditions for “public action” to effectively demand and utilize these inputs."

    "abstract": "Based on qualitative, multisited research, this article examines the impacts of short- and long-term international migration to the Middle East and the West on the Mar Thoma Syrian Christian demonination of Kerala. Migrants and their foreign-born children have new demands and expectations, and significant financial contributions have led to adjustments in the orientation and functioning of the denomination and its clergy. Large-scale emigration has also had indirect effects. International networks and the economic affluence of the population, along with a rise in social problems caused by migration and consumerism, have led to the rise of evangelical and charismatic transdenominational churches in Kerala that challenge the functioning of established Christian denominations such as the Mar Thoma. Church leaders have been trying to bring about changes to address these developments, but are constrained by the tradition, structure, and the mission of the churches. I draw on theories of organizational religious change and theories of transnationalism to explain the process of social change in Kerala, also addressing some limitations of these theories."

    "abstract": "Vertical models of communication and information transfer have the tenacity to be static and have proven ineffective to reach those living in the lower socioeconomic group of the society. In this context, a fluid model that emphasizes participation and communicative action is more meaningful for information sharing and knowledge gathering. The study proposes the informate–communicate–educate framework to serve as a guide for developing Information and Communication Technologies applications and mHealth solutions. Based on this framework, an mHealth application (K-unit Health Information Dashboard (KHID)) is developed to facilitate the reporting and tracking of reproductive health issues among women living in marginalized communities in the State of Kerala, India. Through a participatory process that uses the horizontal model of communication, the paper demonstrates how the KHID application enables knowledge sharing, and disease surveillance to address reproductive health issues."

    "abstract": "Understanding the economic development of many nations in the Global South can no longer be comprehensively charted without a focus on international labour migration and its associated socio-economic and spatial transformations. Interest in this issue has emerged in the range of work exploring transnational migration, yet the spatiality of transnational practices has tended to be overlooked in much of this literature, which has tended to focus more intently on social practices to the neglect of related spatial transformations. In this paper, I explore and contrast outmigration from two Indian states in order to identify the differences and similarities that emerge. In particular, I emphasise the way in which migration and the role of non-resident Indians (NRIs) articulates with pre-existing local socio-spatial distinctions and networks of social closure. The migrant figure embodies a powerful influence that introduces new expectations and consumption patterns into the sending region, and this process occurs both in Kerala and Punjab, two Indian states with long and active histories of outmigration. Changes wrought by the migrant need to be understood as the outcome of specific sets of locally grounded relations, but also as the product of the pressures of global, regional and national discourses of modernity, development and neo-liberal consumerism."

    "abstract": "In the context of cost-cutting and austerity measures, public sector software based on the principles and technologies of free and open source software is increasingly being used by governments in both the developed and developing worlds. The move to adopt non-proprietorial software has been precipitated by a number of factors apart from cost, including the recognition of the effects of vendor lock-in, the consequences of efficiency deficits linked to the lack of inter-operability of software across sectors and departments, the recognition of the failure of existing software policy and its consequences, particularly a heightened comprehension of risk, and the realisation of the need for informational independence. This article explores public sector software as a ‘public good’, with specific reference to the IT@School project in Kerala state, India, that has enabled access and, in that process, empowered local, state-funded secondary school teachers and students to define, shape and create their own informational futures."

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on the fishing hamlet of Adimalathura located on the coast of the Thiruvananthapuram district in Kerala, which has been identified as an area of extreme developmental disadvantage. Without claiming to be a full-fledged local history, it seeks to construct, through the memories of selected local residents, a coherent narrative of the past which would help us contextualise the present in this site. Tracing the intertwined trajectories of land, politics, development, and home-life at Adimalathura through in-depth interviews with local residents, it reflects upon the ‘multiple governmentalities’, that of the Catholic Church and the State, that have shaped everyday life in this hamlet. It is argued that the specific form of marginalisation experienced by the people here is that of dispossession. Of particular  interest is the shaping of an ‘oppositional civil society’ here in the late-20th century, which challenged this dispossession, but which is now being reshaped into a more non-oppositional ‘state-centric’ civil society."

It stops  in the mid-90s, when decentralisation and women’s self-help-groups began a new phase of social change. It focuses mainly on changing vicissitudes of land, politics, work and domestic life in this urban slum to reflect on the specific form of marginalisation that the residents of this pocket of extreme disadvantage have suffered since its earliest days, in the mid-20th century, which I refer to as ‘marginalisation by abjection’. It also examines the usefulness of widely-used concepts such as ‘political society’ to make sense of politics there, and concludes by cautioning against the perfunctory use of concepts such as political society and clientilism."

    "abstract": "The “poverty-in-context” approach to understanding poverty is shaped by the needs and priorities of a particular context, and it can be used as the basis for identifying pro-poor projects in local strategies such as City Development Plans. A key argument for the introduction of the City Development Plans initiative (2007–2012) in India was to move away from national conceptions of and responses to poverty and to instead focus on engaging with local understandings of poverty. Through a case study of the City Development Plan initiative in Trivandrum, the capital city of the Kerala state in southern India, we argue that an understanding of poverty at the local level did not accommodate contextual needs and priorities; consequently, we develop a poverty-in-context approach based on semi-structured qualitative interviews with various stakeholders in the case study area. The article concludes by suggesting how in the future a poverty-in-context approach might be used to shape pro-poor policy in general and preparation of City Development Plans in particular."

    "abstract": "Gender disparities are a major ethical concern in renal donation and transplantation. Relatively few Indian studies, each limited by small sample sizes, have investigated the problem of gender disparities in renal transplantation. A retrospective, cross-sectional study was conducted using data collected from kidney transplantation centers in Kerala, a Southern State of India, to analyze the gender disparity in kidney donation and transplantation. Data were collected on gender, age, and relationship of the donor to the recipient.\n\nAmong 592 related cases, 74.2% of donors were female and 25.8% male (P<0.0001). In the case of recipients, 76.2% were male and 23.8% female (P<0.0001). Among 110 unrelated donors, 30.9% were female and 69.1% male (P<0.0001), while the recipients were 78.2% male and 21.8% female (P<0.0001). The number of cadaver kidney transplantations (6) was too small for analysis.\n\nThe study found that the majority of living-related donors are family members (first degree relatives) of the affected patients, with a definite female gender disparity among donors and recipients, more pronounced than reported in other studies. This disparity was absent in the case of living-unrelated donors, however. Existing practices in the organ transplantation process should be reviewed in order to eliminate the donor gender disparity in India. Kidney transplantation registries and organ matching systems at the national, state, and district levels are necessary for accountability and regulation of the transplantation process in India."

    "abstract": "The major problem of the engineering entrance examination is the exclusion of certain sections of the society in social, economic, regional and gender dimensions. This has seldom been taken for analysis towards policy correction. To lessen this problem a minor policy shift was prepared in the year 2011 with a 50–50 proportion in academic marks and entrance marks. The impact of this change is yet to be scrutinized. The data for the study is obtained from the Nodal Centre of Kerala functioning at Cochin University of Science and Technology under the National Technical Manpower Information System and also estimated from the Centralized Allotment Process. The article focuses on two aspects of exclusion based on engineering entrance examination; gender centred as well as caste-linked. Rank order spectral density and Lorenz ratio are used to cognize the exclusion and inequality in community and gender levels in various performance scales. The article unfolds the fact that social status in society coupled with economic affordability to quality education seems to have significant influence in the performance of students in the Kerala engineering entrance examinations. But it also shows that there is wide gender disparity with respect to performance in the high ranking levels irrespective of social groups."

It is based on a comparative study that seeks to probe the question of access based on a secondary data analysis using the NSSO data regarding household consumer expenditure in education in the state of Odisha, one of the poorest Indian states compared to the two advanced states in human development and access to technical education, Kerala and Tamil Nadu respectively. The study finds that the overall access to HE in Odisha is a privilege of the urban area non-scheduled category of population belonging to the upper and middle income group, that too in case of technical/professional education. The poor representation of reserved categories in urban areas makes them incapable of making use of the reservation facilities provided by the government due to their ignorance. Most of the benefits of the reserved categories of population are appropriated by the affluent sections of population of that category. The overambitious urban students supersede their counterparts in Kerala and Tamil Nadu in primary and secondary education and rural students in terms of demand and access to technical/professional education."

The book provides a comprehensive appraisal of the policies, legislation and institutional architecture governing emigration at both federal and state levels. It posits that, geographically, emigration is now a more inclusive, pan-India phenomenon with many distinct features.\n\nIt draws critical attention to the multiple dualities in Indian emigration, showing how the artificial distinction between a universal pravasi (‘expatriate’ or ‘migrant’) and a restricted aam pravasi (‘common emigrant’) distorts emigration governance. On the basis of extensive data from the Kerala Migration Survey (KMS) and National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO) Rounds, it projects the emerging profile of the emigrant from new source states as also the likely number of migrants by 2021, drawing cross-country comparisons where appropriate. The work will be invaluable to scholars of migration and diaspora studies, economics, development studies and sociology, as well as policy makers, administrators, academics, and non-governmental organisations in the field.\n\n‘[A] rare example of thoughtful analysis of India’s policy options built on solid empirical foundations.’ — Devesh Kapur, Director, Center for the Advanced Study of India, University of Pennsylvania"

Results show that the impact of new developmental interventions through VRCs is significant in knowledge diffusion, innovativeness, and productivity of farming communities and, it can be quantitatively measured. VRCs help improve the quality of life in villages by providing new knowledge at the doorstep of the common man, in vernacular language, thereby reducing information inequality and the emergence of a new socio-economic relationship."

In a groundbreaking time-space budgeting survey among travelers in Kerala, India, a contradictory reality was discovered. Western travelers interacted mainly with local service providers, in an instrumental manner. Spontaneous contacts occurred mostly during their travel days when situations such as sharing a train compartment ‘forced’ the interaction. Interestingly, the ‘genuine’ contacts with locals were least common on leisure days when there was maximum freedom to look for them. The interest for difference was apparently satisfied in less demanding engagements. An analysis of the spatiotemporalities of the traveler everyday challenged and gave measure to several assumed features of travel culture."

This line of inquiry is particularly relevant in Kerala, south India, where, for reasons including felt obligation, the political economy of allopathic mental health care, and desires for social prestige, many psychologists and psychiatrists actively engage the public as lecturers, authors, and guests of television and radio programs alongside their clinical work. Ethnographic attention to discursive activity in the public sphere reveals how these experts blur the boundaries between clinical and popular registers of speech and forge alternative ethical sensibilities and values that challenge institutionally prescribed ideas of clinical professionalism. They do so in ways that can attract reprobation and accusations of quackery among critical peers who hold competing ideas of where, how, and to whom mental health professionals “should” speak."

    "abstract": "The emergence of the communist movement in Kerala, India in a society that\nwas characterized by immense divisions of caste and class is significant for\nunderstanding social transformation. What is of particular importance is the\nways in which the communist activists who spoke the language of a supposedly\nalien ideology engaged with a populace that was predominantly agrarian and\npoor. This paper will look at the communist engagement with certain aspects\nof culture, specifically songs, folk arts and theater, in the initial years\nof the movement, and will argue that something akin to a national-popular\nwill was constructed, which broke down many existing hierarchies and created\nnew unities. But this engagement was equally characterized by many\ncontradictions and spectacular failures, which dented the emerging\nnational-popular will. The cultural, and the communist engagement with it\nplayed a crucial role in laying the seeds of a substantive postcolonial\ndemocracy but only in relative terms and without necessarily conferring on\nthe most exploited classes equal rights."

The three waves of National Family Health Survey (NFHS) conducted during 1992–1993 (NFHS-1), 1998–1999 (NFHS-2) and 2005–2006 (NFHS-3) were used to construct a composite index of coverage gap in four areas of health-care interventions: family planning, maternal and newborn care, immunization and treatment of sick children.\n\nThe central, eastern and northeastern regions of India reported a higher coverage gap in maternal and child health care services during 1992–2006, while the rural–urban difference in the coverage gap has increased in Gujarat, Haryana, Rajasthan and Kerala over the period. Region or area-specific focus in order to increase the coverage of maternal and child health care services in India should be the priority of the policy-makers and programme executors."

    "abstract": "Dowry payments from the family of the bride to that of the groom were rarely encountered in Kerala during the early twentieth century, but now are almost universal. Based on an examination of historical documents, including legislative debates, court cases, and reports, the way dowry was explained in the past is compared with the results of 200 contemporary interviews to determine its current rationale. Nowadays, making an obligatory payment for the maintenance of a wife, adherence to a social norm, and guaranteeing a woman's good treatment have displaced earlier arguments related to inheritance, status in the social hierarchy, or a woman's ability to provide for herself. Although several blurred traditions have been cited to account for dowries, they seem to have flourished in times of social inequity and uncertainty: the 1930s, 1970s, and 1990s. The emphasis on patriarchal nuclear families has created a mentality that a woman must pay for the privilege of being married and living securely."

    "abstract": "This article presents new knowledge on the link between dowry and instances of abuse against newly married women. It draws on data collected during structured and in-depth interviews and focus groups involving 60 women in Kerala. The data argue that despite decades of campaigning by women's groups' dowry is still widely practised. Furthermore, the links between dowry, harassment and violence remain. The qualitative analysis of the data reveals how most people hold complex and seemingly contradictory views on dowry. Placing these views along a continuum with ‘dowry is a problem’ and ‘dowry is necessary’ at each end enables a picture to emerge of why dowry remains hard to eradicate. Most informants were clear that dowry represents a key problem for women; they also said they would continue to give dowry because it was the only way to secure a ‘good’ marriage. The data did reveal cracks in the patriarchal system; young women were direct identifying dowry as the main problem they faced. Also, indifferent views were voiced by younger men suggesting they may not forcefully act to maintain the system. Opportunities do exist to push wider holes in the system which could in turn spark the transformation still needed."

    "abstract": "The study was conducted to document the rearing practices of village chicken production in the Northern midlands, agro-ecological zone.... Data was generated from 65 and 63 chicken farming families of Kozhikode and Kannur districts respectively. The system of chicken rearing is extensive, with the provision of shelter only during the night. The birds are being managed mostly by women (89.06%). The decision on the sale of birds and eggs is made by women and the proceeds of sales go directly to them. It was found that as many as 43.75% of the chicken farmers in these areas have no other animal husbandry activities.\n\nThe average flock size is 5.62 birds. Natural incubation using locally available materials as a nest box and sand as the nesting material is the common practice. The average number of eggs set under the broody hen for hatching is 10.41. Chicken coops are placed at an average distance of 5.45m from the house and elevated 0.39 m from the ground. The average floor area of the coops is 0.757 m2 and the night shelter provided per bird is 830.39 cm2. The walls and floor of the coops are made of wood and the roof with tiles or thatch in most of cases. Rice grain is commonly fed as supplementary feed with mostly no specific timing in feeding. Farmers depend on an array of herbs rather than chemotherapeutic agents and vaccines for the treatment and control of diseases. Most of the surplus males (59.38%) are discarded before one year of age, whereas females are less commonly culled (21.87%). The average culling age of males and females was 11.05 and 36.64 months, respectively. It was discovered that as high as 52.15% of the eggs and 59.38% of the cockerels produced are consumed in the home. When sold they attract at least a two-fold higher price compared to birds of industrial origin."

Rather, while cooperatives seek to gain more of the labour value of the goods they produce, local merchants focus upon aesthetic qualities and claims to regional authenticity through accreditation with Geographical Indication.\n\nHighlights\nEthnography of upgrading strategies for handloom production in northern Kerala.\nThe “Kerala model” and potential for brand value of ethical production.\nAnalysis of uneven power structures across horizontal production networks.\nVisibility of ethics dependent upon distance from primary producers.\nRegional aesthetics of value masks imbalance of value distribution."

In this context, rather than take centre and periphery for granted, the author attempts a processual geography of method. \n\nDrawing on data from a 19-month ethnography in the Indian state of Kerala, the author first traces the materials production process and reifications of resistance to argue that method produces centres. \n\nSpecifically, privileged actors rearranged the terms of recognition from literacy to orality to resist supposedly structural, behaviourist pedagogies but in effect mandated resistance to locally available literacy resources. \n\nThen, foregrounding the quality of classroom life (Kumaravadivelu, 2006a) under reform conditions, the author witnesses diverse regimes of shame. \n\nKumaravadivelu (2006b) distinguishes methods (“established methods conceptualised and constructed by experts”) from methodologies (“what practicing teachers actually do in the classroom” to achieve their teaching objectives, p. 84). \n\nBecause the material and affective registers of classroom life emerged as crucial domains of experience, the author attempts an intersectional analysis that foregrounds the material (Block, 2015; Ramanathan, 2008) in conjunction with that of the affective (Motha & Lin, 2013). \n\nEthnographic attention to the “schema of agents, levels, and processes” (Ricento & Hornberger, 1996, p. 408) entailed in the production and consumption of a method illuminates the multiple and complex ways in which marginality is engendered and lived."

It has intervened in several important arenas of public life in Kerala, namely in education, health, ecological issues, and in the people’s planning experiment in the state during the decade of the 1990s. \n\nThis paper deals specifically with the experience of women activists in the movement, who, though middle class in their social location, are outnumbered, dispersed, and rendered insignificant in several ways within the movement, which boasts of a membership base almost 48,000 strong. \n\nAs activists, they have to negotiate in both private and public lives in order to remain active within the movement. \n\nThis paper is an account of a few select activists of the movement and ways in which they attempt to participate meaningfully, negotiating social structure and hierarchy. \n\nAbjuring generalisation, this paper goes on to argue that marginality does not necessarily derive from class position; it is recreated and negotiated differently in different contexts."

The study uses data amassed from various state government departments. Land alienation and housing segregation are the two inseparable rudiments that tend to act and react upon each other, forcing the tribes to remain in a dismal state of poverty. Despite the existence of strong legislation and numerous housing and resettlement schemes, land still remains a mirage to the tribal population. Various housing schemes of both the central and the state governments have not made any beneficial change in the quality of housing of the tribes. Ironing out the loopholes in the implementation of the tribal legislation and schemes is the only way out. Some visible changes have taken place in the housing and settlement patterns of landowning tribes such as the Kurumans and the Malayarayans."

Gandhi waged a satyagraha to gain access for excluded groups to these routes encircling the temple compound.\n\nAs the 604-day campaign under Gandhi’s leadership persisted, it gripped British India and beyond, while revealing extreme forms of discrimination practiced by the upper castes: untouchability, unapproachability, and unseeability. Authors writing for Western readers from the 1930s onward offered romanticized accounts of the campaign, which spread the belief that a solution was reached to this particular conflict that stemmed from conversion of the high-caste Brahmins, whose hearts and minds were touched.\n\nThe book substantiates a narrative of what actually happened at Vykom, including its controversial settlement. It also examines Gandhi’s concept of conversion through self-imposed suffering—the way that he insisted that social change would occur—as a dangerous presumption. Correcting misunderstandings, it addresses the rarity of conversion as a mechanism of change, and evaluates shortcomings of Gandhi’s leadership, which in this instance were based on certain faulty principles.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIntroduction\n1.

    "abstract": "The trajectories of the twentieth-century modernization of Ayurveda varied in different parts of India. This article, which is based on interviews with Ayurvedic practitioners from several social backgrounds and training modalities, analyzes the social dimensions of Ayurveda’s transformation in twentieth-century Kerala, South India. It argues that in the twentieth century Ayurvedic practitioners from two caste groups, Ezhavas and Brahmans, who belonged to established medical lineages were active in the institutionalization of a distinctive therapeutic tradition in the region that is now known as Kerala. Both groups devised new pedagogic, clinical, and manufacturing strategies to protect their family- and caste-based medical lineages and made good use of the new avenues offered by the modern state, modernized Ayurvedic education, and the market to reproduce, adapt, and consolidate their position in Ayurveda in the region. The concept of “inheritance capital” is used to explore the consolidation and reproduction of regional medical lineages and the associated social advantages over successive generations."

These gripping accounts are of healers, soldiers, artists, ascetics, thieves, pirates and courtesans who were not powerful or privileged. Often they were escaping poverty or religious persecution; many were brought here as slaves; others simply followed their spirit of adventure. \n\nChinali, a Chinese sailor of indeterminate origin, became the trusted lieutenant of Kunhali Marikkar, a legendary warlord on the Malabar Coast who harassed and resisted Portuguese colonisers. \n\nDe Lannoy, a Dutch sea captain taken captive by Marthanda Varma of Travancore, managed to win his captor’s trust and was placed in command of his army. Known locally as Dillanai, he helped reorganise the fortifications of Travancore and modernise its army, with lasting effect."

    "abstract": "The Western Ghats, the bold westerly escarpment of India paralleling the west coast, are characterized by different geologic and geomorphic units formed during different episodes of Earth’s history. The majority of these present day landforms evolved in response to the tectonic activity that the Western Ghats witnessed during the Tertiary period. The major structural features together with the geomorphic units have predominant role in the occurrence of cataclysmic landslides which the windward slope of Western Ghats witness during the peak monsoon season. The Kerala and Periyar lineaments, which are the sites of minor earthquakes, pass through the study area. Escarpments and structural hill systems are the vulnerable landforms for landslide occurrence. Due to the predominant role of these tectonic and geomorphic features in the capricious change of landforms, a study was carried out in this hilly terrain based on geomorphology. The study of soil, slope morphometry, relative relief, land use/land cover and hydrogeological conditions together with a multidimensional analysis in a GIS environment resulted in classifying the entire area into different landslide susceptible zones based on Bureau of Indian Standards. Moreover, the area is also divided into three zones based on the terrain conditions and the type of landslide occurrence. The methodology can well fit with any area experiencing the same terrain conditions and can be used to classify an area on the basis of landslide occurrence and geomorphology."

    "abstract": "This article studies the interplay between Siddha medicine and Santhigiri, a Hindu guru organization in South India. Based on insights gained through ethnographic research in Kerala and Tamil Nadu, it analyzes how Santhigiri fashions itself as an indispensable actor in the restoration of Siddha medicine and valorizes its current Siddha medical activities. The article examines the dynamics that facilitate Santhigiri’s patronage of Siddha medicine and contribute to its continuing participation in the Siddha medical system. This social formation is conceptualized through the Bourdieusian framework of capital, arguing that Santhigiri’s appropriation of Siddha medicine bestows symbolic capital upon the organization, enabling it to secure and maintain a favorable position in the field of Hindu guru organizations. Furthermore, the article shows how, by adopting Siddha medicine, a religious organization such as Santhigiri with the necessary structural and financial means and a reputation for transcending economic interests extends the distribution of Siddha medicine beyond the Tamil community. Thus, the article emphasizes the reciprocal relationship between a religious organization and a medical system, arguing for the explanatory potential of conceiving of medicine as effective capital for religious organizations and, vice versa, of religious organizations as actors shaping the realm of medicine in India."

Lack of market integration and limited information on non-local products often leave consumers unaware of the prices and quality of non-local firms. They therefore mostly buy locally, limiting firms' potential market size (and competition). We explore this hypothesis using a natural experiment in the Kerala boat-building industry. As consumers learn more about non-local builders, high quality builders gain market share and grow, while low quality firms exit. Aggregate quality increases, as does labor specialization, and average production costs decrease. Finally, quality-adjusted consumer prices decline."

    "abstract": "This article juxtaposes a notion of “gift” as construction of submission and devotion with a concept of lesson as something to be purchased for a fixed fee, as both relate to drumming pedagogy in Kerala. It discusses how guru dakṣiṇa (a ritual marking the beginning of study and a ceremonial first performance) and a pattern of irregular and grandiose remuneration construct the student’s submission to his teacher, both in private contexts and in institutions. However, the system at a state arts institution partly undercuts this practice; here, students, especially non-Malayāḷis, pay monthly, semesterly, or annual fees to the institution. The impersonal nature of this arrangement contrasts with the intimacy inherent in patterns of remuneration in private contexts, yet at the same time guru dakṣiṇa and other traditional practices continue in the institution. Thus the institution features an uneasy coexistence between a notion of pedagogy as regular payment—something close to “commodity”—and one of construction of submission, mixed with intimacy and devotion."

    "abstract": "It is now over 15 years since the aerial spraying of endosulfan over cashew plantations was stopped (and subsequently banned) in Kasaragod, Kerala. Thousands of individuals have been affected in permanent ways in the exposed villages. As there are potentially several important lessons to be learned from this experience, it would be useful to reflect on the decision-making that led to the design of the spraying programme and examine the efforts that are being made towards managing these health impacts. Through the lens of public health ethics, this chapter seeks to explore the design and implementation of the relief and remediation programme at Kasaragod, the identification of and support provided to victims and the role played by actors including experts, local community and local government. The chapter concludes with a discussion on approaches to predict and avoid such occurrences through Health Impact Assessment and the involvement of local people and the challenges that might prevent the adoption of such approaches."

    "abstract": "Sustainability is considered as a remedy for the environmental issues arising due to overconsumption of natural resources. In this context, the general household consumption pattern in India and—one of its states—Kerala has been studied for a period of 50 years. Generally Monthly Per capita Consumer Expenditure (MPCE) is linked with consumption, disparities in consumption pattern among different sectors of the society and sustainability at large. This study is based on the data from National Sample Survey Organization, Government of India. The findings of this study indicate that the MPCE has gone up for India and Kerala during the study period. The state of Kerala has an increased MPCE than the country; the rate of increase is twofold for its rural sector and 1.5 fold for the urban sector. Increased consumption consequent to urbanisation has been found to be the cause for the change in consumption pattern of Kerala."

    "abstract": "On the 24th of August 2014 the state of Kerala announced that alcohol will be progressively banned through different phases, with a plan of implementing a complete ban by 2025. The ban was eased in July 2017; yet, it sparked heated debates about its impacts on the tourism industry, which highlighted the strong nexus between alcohol and tourism. Despite animated discussions continued online for months after the announcement of the ban, there have not been studies assessing the impact of the ban on tourism/tourists. Through a thematic analysis of online texts published on TripAdvisor, this paper explores tourists’ perceptions and opinions of the implementation of the ‘Dry Law’ in Kerala. Moreover, this work also investigates whether the ban discouraged potential tourists to visit Kerala. Overall, our analysis reveals that the ban did not discourage potential tourists to visit Kerala, although many regarded the possibility of having moderate amounts of alcohol on holiday as pleasant. Importantly, our study also contends that the narratives about the ‘Dry Law’ produced and propagated online were often representative of political structures of power, which linked tourism to alcohol irrespective of the real impact of the ban on tourism."

Much like Foucault’s concept of the \"author function,\" the addressee function is ideological in that it operates as a control over the proliferation of meaning. \n\nShe shows how in cognitive and rhetorical narratologies, as well as in Gayatri Spivak’s deployment of narratological concepts in her postcolonial theory of reading, this function appears in the way each model contains an implicit pedagogy. \n\nPointing to the leakage of meaning through the addressee function, Dwivedi reads O. V. Vijayan and isolates a distinct technique in his Legends of Khasak, which she calls \"dispersive focalization.\""

It traces the shifting contexts in which Muslim fisherwomen, alternately, engaged in and disengaged from, paid work outside the household and shows how women experienced different kinds of paid work, as self-employed fish vendors and wage earners of employment guarantee schemes. Changes in women’s labor force participation were mediated by the social institutions of family and religion, community patriarchies and ideologies of female domesticity and the state’s endeavors to constitute women as entrepreneurial actors who take responsibility for the economic well-being of their households. The paper maps women’s struggles to secure and retain paid work in the face of a resurgent domestic feminine ideal and its zealous defenders in their village."

    "abstract": "Ageing and transnational migration are two key processes of transformation in the contemporary world. Kerala has become the site for both these processes of transformation. While the state has had a history of large-scale transnational migration, which has had far-reaching influence on the economic and social fabric of the state, the ageing of its population has been a more recent phenomenon. \n\nRapid demographic transition, population ageing and widespread transnational migration have come together to define the larger socio-demographic context of the state. Large-scale migration has dictated the absence of the younger generation of family caregivers, whereas an intensification of ageing in Kerala has resulted in a growing need for care for older persons staying behind. \n\nIn this context, the paper discusses the implications of transnational migration of younger generation on the care for the older persons staying behind, examining the transnational care strategies and provisioning of care within the transnational families, in the empirical context of Kerala, which is at the forefront of both migration and ageing."

    "abstract": "Kerala is an ageing society wherein population ageing is proceeding at a very fast pace. Given the context of ageing in Kerala, the living arrangements of the elderly have an important role, particularly when it comes to elder care. \n\nUsing the Kerala Aging Survey 2013, this paper evaluates the scenario of family care for the elderly, the perception of elderly about their care, association between health patterns and living arrangements and the determinants of living arrangements of the elderly. Bivariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression were used for the analysis. \n\nThe findings of the study revealed that living arrangements of the elderly play an important role in elderly care. Among those who live with partners, more than 45% were of the view that it is the duty of children to take care of their parents in old age. More than 43% of the elderly who live with their partner consider living with their partner as the best option. Among those who live with married sons, nearly 60% perceived that such a life is best for them. Among those who stayed with sons and daughters, the share of those who need special care is comparatively greater. \n\nLiving arrangements determine the source of care provision when special care is required. Results of the regression analysis showed that compared to female elderly, male elderly are less likely to live alone. Further, it was found that compared to female elderly, male elderly are more likely to live with a daughter."

    "abstract": "Several attempts have been made to assess the quality of life of older people through objective measurement of various factors such as health, income, economic and social status. \n\nHowever, the self-perception of well-being has emerged as a critical axis to understand the experience of older people and their overall well-being. This emphasis on subjectivity and experience coincides with the cultural turn that the field of gerontology has recently encountered. \n\nThis study locates the conceptual framework within this epistemological turn and uses the subjective well-being inventory (SUBI) from the Kerala Aging Survey 2013. \n\nThe goal of this study is straightforward. First, it reviews theoretical and empirical work from an interdisciplinary standpoint and sifts through diverse cultural contexts to highlight the complex interactions between family structure, social membership, (physical) health, and subjective well-being. \n\nSecond, it offers a descriptive analysis to determine the socio-cultural antecedents of well-being among older adults in Kerala. \n\nThe analysis suggests that age, marital status, gender, household size, education, grandparenting roles, and normative expectations are key determinants of subjective well-being. Not surprisingly, subjective well-being is shown to become worse as one grows older, though this association is amplified for older women. \n\nAnalysis also suggests that loneliness experienced by the respondents is often a product of a perceived sense of lag between expectations and their fulfilment. \n\nOverall, the study provided a nuanced understanding of the critical links between family structure, cultural expectations, socio-demographic factors, and subjective well-being of older Indians in a changing demographic context."

It also investigates the reasons for such a shift in preference. \n\nEven after the preference for private funding became clear, there were dissenting voices. The logic of the dissenting arguments is also discussed. \n\nThis review will assess three important experiments undertaken in the State of Kerala during 2006 and 2011 in favour of a publicly funded and socially responsive educational system. They were: (i) working out a formula for equitable distribution of government grants to universities on the basis of performance and needs; (ii) steps towards social preparation for higher education with focused merit-cum-means scholarships; and (iii) an attempt at clustering of colleges with diverse capacities, which can eventually turn into decentralized and flexible universities or university like formations at the district level."

The ability of a household to diversify has been shown to depend upon its demographic and economic characteristics and its physical and social context. \n\nThis paper considers the effects of intra-village social networks on household income diversification in one of the poorest and most ethnically diverse areas of the Indian state of Kerala. \n\nUsing techniques adapted from spatial econometrics, we find that social connections within a village magnify the impacts of household characteristics such as education and number of adults by a factor of 3.6 times. \n\nModels with alternative measures of network centrality (degree and eigenvector) indicate that the number of network connections that a household has is more important than the centrality of those connections. \n\nFinally, we use social contact information to calculate assortative mixing based on caste. The results suggest social stratification in these villages, with higher levels of stratification associated with lower levels of income diversification."

    "abstract": "The everyday life of the congregations of slave castes involved the active support of women, right from the mid-19th century when Dalit communities began to accept Christianity. \n\nPrayers in the family and in congregations were occasions in which women were substantially involved, wherein hymns/songs became powerful articulations of the critique of caste slavery and prayer was used as an effective tool to resist instances of caste oppression. \n\nHowever, relatively blurred gender hierarchies in the pre-Christian phase among the slave castes were transformed by the conscious intervention of the missionaries in favour of the secure family structure with an assertive male head."

    "abstract": "This chapter considers the migration of Syrian Christian peasants from the cultivated plains of rural Travancore to the pristine and sparsely inhabited mountain forests of Malabar. \n\nStarting in the early decades of the twentieth century and continuing well into the 1960s, this migration picked up in the 1940s. Over more than forty years, tens of thousands of Christian migrants colonized huge tracts of fallow land, turning hills and forests into highly profitable farms and plantations. \n\nThis chapter argues that the Syrian Christian Church was directly involved in this modernist enterprise of turning \"empty\" environments into sites of human activity, production and development. \n\nIt did so not only by offering a theological rationale for land reclamation and its hegemonic developmentalist ideology, but also by leading the political struggle of the laity to protect its arduously won material world in Malabar from state interventions.\n\nThis chapter also suggests that in its engagement with the modern economic sphere, the Church and its narratives did not stick to any single line of reasoning. It straddled theological, nationalist, economic, ethical and humanitarian rationalities with ease and careful calibration, moving freely between the spiritual and the material with claims of morality and citizenship and building bridges with \"anti-religious\" communist ideology. \n\nBy demonstrating the role of the Church in fostering and eventually defending modern forms of capital accumulation, the chapter complicates teleologies of the modern that prophesied the progressive withering away of religion as a result of expansive political and economic rationalities."

    "abstract": "In September 2015, some 5000 women workers of the Kannan Devan Hills Plantation, a large tea estate in Munnar in Kerala, launched a spontaneous agitation demanding increased wages and bonuses. \n\nThey staged a massive sit-in in Munnar town, bringing operations on the tea-estate to a halt. What was unique about this strike, which garnered considerable domestic media attention, was its non-violent nature and distancing from party-affiliated tea-plantation unions. \n\nIn this paper, we use interview transcripts from a community radio programme to analyze whether this strike can be seen as a precursor for a “new unionism” of the great mass of contractual, informal workers in India. We do so within the broader question of whether class identity is still relevant for informal labour in the global south. \n\nWe conclude that a successful working class movement can only emerge when workers understand their roles in the long and convoluted chain of profits and are able to universalize their situations through concrete political action."

    "abstract": "This chapter aims to understand the self-projection of Kerala through Ayurveda tourism and what this is doing to concepts of masculinity and femininity and to the idea of development. The author focuses on actual female and male bodies as producers and consumers of Ayurveda tourism, arguing that the rigidity of what constitutes femininity and masculinity is not questioned, but who possesses it is interchanged. This in turn exposes the construction of the binary opposition between femininity and masculinity as there exist multiple combinations of masculinity and femininity at any given time and space. Touching upon debates around modernity and tradition in Ayurveda tourism, the author argues that the dominant ideas of men as active, and women as passive, are shaped by the discourse of upper caste Hindus and colonial modernity. The predominant trend, throughout world, to understand development as something only related to economic growth has gained momentum in Kerala. What this paper emphasizes is the fact that Ayurveda tourism may have contributed to economic growth of the state at the cost of subaltern communities, but it has not addressed the cause of ‘economic justice’ in the state. The researcher raises political questions in the field of Ayurveda and development, trying to redefine the political and re-looking at interactions of plural femininity and masculinity."

And public health research needs to underscore this approach."

Today, several branches of Keyi families remain a cultural unit in the Islamic community of Kerala. \n\nThis article attempts to locate the group in the larger theoretical context of Indian Ocean cosmopolitanism and argues that the Keyis developed a distinct and significant type of coastal cosmopolitanism in an Indian Ocean setting; Chovakkaran Moosa, an influential merchant from a Keyi family during the colonial period, serves as a representative figure. \n\nThrough their trade and financial relationships with British and local elites, and the characteristic architecture of their warehouses, residences, and mosques, the Keyis successfully integrated the practices of a global cosmopolitan space into a local vernacular secluded commercial space. \n\nThis article presents a synthesis of a lively coastal urban and local rural cosmopolitanism that included several networks and exchanges, foreign and native collaborations, and an amalgamation of local and external cultural spheres."

This enables an exploration of the implications of this residence norm for women, and particularly its implications for our understanding of the transformation of matrilineal kinship in Kerala. \n\nPaying special attention to the experience of women in tharavad houses and the creation of new houses, coupled with the continuities in the right that a woman retains to residence in her natal house and a right to a share of the property, forces us to question the common sense understanding that matriliny has transformed to patriliny."

    "abstract": "The amplification of religious sound in public spaces has become a key medium for negotiating identity, difference, and pluralism in societies worldwide. This paper explores the religious soundscape of Hindu traditions in Kerala, India by examining the role of sonic amplification in the sacrifices of Nambudiri Brahmins. \n\nWhile Brahmanical praxis is based on ancient liturgies from the first millennium BCE, the modern performance now incorporates microphones and loudspeakers that amplify recitations well beyond the power of the human voice. This technological shift coincides with significant changes in patronage and participation, as people from outside the Nambudiri community take a more active role in the funding, organization, and celebration of such rituals. \n\nIn contrast to the private sacrifices of previous generations, the 'amplified sacrifice' is now carried out as a public Hindu festival with thousands of attendees and a full suite of marketing and media coverage. In this way, the local, sonic amplification of performance tracks with a regional, cultural 'amplification' of Vedic ritual and Nambudiri identity."

This article attempts to disentangle this enigma by comparing the Minangkabau, Kerala and coastal northern Mozambique that represent the most well-known cases of simultaneous practice of Islam and matrilineal kinship, which initially was a result of peaceful Islamisation through Indian Ocean networks. \n\nIn the nineteenth century, the Dutch and British colonial regimes helped matriliny to survive, despite all the efforts of the Islamists to the contrary, by codifying local juridical rules. The Portuguese integration of the local matrilineal nobility into their colonial administrative system preserved matriliny within the local Muslim order. \n\nNowadays these communities are influenced by modernisation, nation-state policies, and Islamic reformist movements, but matrilineal principles still regulate the use of the ancestral land."

    "abstract": "Although castes are organizing as cross-border formations empirically, the literature seems preoccupied with analyzing caste diasporas in terms of the boundaries of the nation-state. This article examines how digital caste networks serve as border-spanning caste diaspora by drawing on Steven Vertovec’s conceptualization of a diaspora. The analysis draws on ethnographic data to analyze the case of the Cyber Thiyyars of Malabar, a digital caste network that seeks to mobilize members of the Thiyya caste by foregrounding regional affiliations with Malabar."

    "abstract": "Development is complete only with genuine acknowledgment of the roles of women as well as their active engagement in all forums – political, economic, and social forums – in life. Providing a conducive environment for women has been a developmental debate in India for many decades now. Yet India’s progress and performance on women’s empowerment and gender mainstreaming leave much to be desired by global standards. \n\nWomen who venture into business or entrepreneurial activities seek active support – spousal and familial – right from the beginning stage of the venture. However, experience seems to suggest that such perceived support systems turn around and in themselves present social impediments to the healthy development of women-lead enterprises. \n\nThis article is a case study that attempts to portray the travails of a group of young women who attempted to launch an enterprise in a rurban setting. This article describes the social challenges posed to the Unarvu Self-Help Group, in the Trivandrum district of Kerala, and their resilience in overcoming these impediments. \n\nThis article is a reflection of the experience undergone by many women, and also showcases the resilience generated by self-motivated women venturing as entrepreneurs in the wake of resistance and impediments. The article is a qualitative portrayal of experiences of a social worker trainee in dealing with the issues hindering women entrepreneurship. This also opens up new avenues for professional social work engagement."

    "abstract": "Technology integration for enhancing productivity and income from coconut farming, facilitated through stakeholder participation, was a major objective of the NAIP sub-project on ‘Value chain in coconut’ implemented in a consortium mode with ICAR-Central Plantation Crops Research Institute, Kasaragod as the lead institute. To achieve this objective, 10 clusters of coconut farmers were formed under the project in selected panchayats of Kasaragod district in Kerala state. A total of 534 farmers covering 250 ha participated in the project interventions. Appropriate production technologies were integrated in their holdings which included intercropping, growing of leguminous crops in the coconut basin, organic recycling through vermicomposting and integrated nutrient management. Group action was initiated among the farmers for taking up need-based integrated disease management measures especially to control bud rot disease of coconut. Knowledge and skill upgradation of farmers on the selected technologies were achieved through various institutional and off campus training programmes. The net income from the coconut farming in small and marginal holdings could be increased through the interventions under the project. Technology integration in the holdings also resulted in the increase of coconut productivity from 60 to 112 nuts per palm. Technology integration in small and marginal coconut holdings for higher productivity and income through Community Based Organizations approach is scaled up by other agencies like Coconut Development Board for implementing development/extension programmes."

    "abstract": "This chapter examines how the application of the rasatrialogue, an improvisatory technique, informs the feminist deconstruction of male text in nangiar kuthu, the female performance form of kutiyattam. The enactment of the rasatrialogue makes Poothana a well-defined character with deep emotional conflicts. As an acting technique, the rasatrialogue allows the performer to show three different emotions – usually, love, sadness and anger – consecutively to demonstrate the inner conflicts of the character. Rasatrialogue, as an acting technique, is masculine, which is found in the traditional kutiyattam performance enacted by male performers. The dialectical relationship between the text and performance has been a perennial point of debate in theatre and performance studies. In the course of making an argument on gender and performativity, Judith Butler questions the fixed notions of gender identity, arguing that the gender \"reality\" is created through social performances."

    "abstract": "The Zamorin—ruler of the kingdom of Kozhikode in modern-day Kerala—left an indelible mark on world history when he welcomed Vasco da Gama in 1498. But a few centuries earlier, the Zamorin was only a local chief, heading a few villages.\n\nHow did he become an independent ruler after the disintegration of the Ceras in the twelfth century? How did the Zamorin come to be recognised and legitimised as the ‘king’?\n\nThis story of the creation of an image of royalty is the focus of Zamorins and the Political Culture of Medieval Kerala. Relying on the archival richness of a large collection of unpublished palm leaf manuscripts called Granthavari, documents of the political and royal establishments of the time, this book reconstructs the days of the Zamorin.\n\nIt carefully details the power and authority he claimed and actually wielded, and the various methods through which he sought to legitimise it—elaborate rituals, patronage of temples and scholarship, propagation of art and culture, etc.\n\nWhile the great past was always remembered, the Zamorin’s ‘little kingdom’ depended on the existence, interaction and interdependence of various nodes of power—-the royalty, royal functionaries, locality chiefs, local magnates and temple authorities.\n\nThis book argues that studying these nodes of power, which related themselves to the Zamorin’s court and among themselves through elaborate customs and rituals, is vital to analysing the state structure in late medieval Kerala.\n\nComplete with a foreword by Kesavan Veluthat, this book convincingly argues for the ‘little kingdom’ model to analyse the premodern state in Calicut. Scholars and students of historiography and history, especially of medieval Indian culture and society, will find it immensely useful."

    "abstract": "This paper looks at two governance challenges that sit behind global commitments to deliver ‘cities without slums’: under what conditions can participatory ideals be successfully transferred to housing redevelopment programmes, and under what conditions can participatory slum redevelopment trigger wider shifts towards inclusive urban governance? \n\nIt does so by examining Indian national slum redevelopment policy and its implementation in Kerala’s capital city, Trivandrum (Thiruvananthapuram). Kerala’s track-record of participatory governance and the lead role given to its women-focused poverty alleviation mission, Kudumbashree, in implementing housing projects make it an ideal place in which to examine these questions, and their gender implications. \n\nPrimary data focusing on two housing projects are used to contrast intended governance changes featuring female-centred community participation with their actual operation on the ground. Despite moves to foreground women’s engagement, both projects suffered from shortfalls in institutional design, the inevitable administrative complexity of housing delivery, and resistance from local power brokers. \n\nGiven Kerala’s favourable starting conditions, these outcomes highlight the need for slum redevelopment to be based around a deeper analysis of power dynamics and the explicit articulation of an agenda for inclusion at a city-level if participation is to realise its transformative potential."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates a set of narratives revolving around the experiences of early post-oil migrants from Kerala to the Gulf States. These narratives take different forms such as individuals’ spoken memories, recollections, perspectives, and narrative accounts of events and experiences. \n\nTheir themes range widely from the simple renditions of experience of travel to their subjective account of the history of nation-building in the host countries. As witnesses to many seminal events in the history of the Gulf states, memories of migrants from Kerala must not be merely seen as personal storytelling about the past. Rather, they could be interpreted as a collective effort to retell history in an alternative way. \n\nThey are particularly useful as they open a window into the early South Asian ordinary migrants’ perceptions about a plethora of historical events, such as post colonial transition of Gulf societies, state formation, and nation-building. Such narratives are generally absent from the “standard” records of history of the region."

    "abstract": "In the history of educational provision, the role of European missionary women have been underplayed. They have often been subsumed under general missionary educational activities, without due attention to the specificities of female schooling. This is a pertinent domain because an exploration of gender identities must take into account the educational histories of varying groups of people.  \n\nApart from imparting the three Rs, premised on the Christian faith, schooling practices also manifested itself in the debates on what constituted acceptable moral norms, femininity, family and work across colonial populations.\n\nThis chapter focuses on the female missionaries of the London Missionary Society and their educational endeavours during the nineteenth and early twentieth century in Travancore, south-west India, amongst the women of poor, lower caste groups. It begs the question as to what degree did the  LMS adhere to their missionary ideas in educational activities for colonized women. \n\nDid they simply seek to implement their particular Christian agenda of  producing 'better wives and mothers' or aim at provoking their pupils into breaking away from traditional customs completely?  And if a break from tradition was indeed sought, can their work be evaluated for conceptualising feminist thought and action? In what ways were their attempts appropriated, resisted and influenced by indigenous populations? By raising these questions, the paper attempts to delineate the complexities of missionary women's educational work, its relationship to social change and the limits to the missionary project itself."

It gathers the fruit of nearly two decades of work done at the Centre for Development Studies and poses a collection of chapters on various migration dynamics, from demographic, economic and socio-political perspectives. Just like the earlier rounds of surveys, KMS 2014 is also based on primary data collected from 15,000 households selected at random by a stratified multistage random sampling technique covering all the 63 taluks in the state. The 15,000 sample households in KMS 2014 included 5,000 panel households which were surveyed in earlier surveys, thereby generating a longitudinal panel database on migration and remittances. Furthermore, the panel allows analysing the medium-run and long-run consequences of phenomena such as the global financial crisis in 2009."

First of all, they extended all out support to the triple alliance composed of the Congress Party, Praja Socialist Party (PSP) and the Muslim League against the Communist Party in 1960 election. \n\nThe election campaign of the triple alliance was much funded by the CIA. However the triple alliance won the election, the Communist Party got more votes than in 1957 and it intensified the US agencies to beef up its anti-Communist operations in Kerala and outside. \n\nIt led to the adoption of second method of anti-Communist activities that the US agencies began to give wide publicity in India and outside that the first Communist ministry in Kerala could not make any economic advancement in Kerala during their tenure nor could they redress the chronic problems of unemployment and food scarcity and if Communists were voted to power in other parts of Asia, they would follow the same trend and fall."

    "abstract": "(Chapter excerpt) Migration is a very complex social process, and the factors associated with migration are more diverse and intertwined. A number of theories and models like Ravenstein’s (1889) ‘The Laws of Migration’, Stouffer’s (1940) ‘Model of Intervening Opportunities’, Lee’s (1966) ‘A Theory of Migration’ and many micro studies have been done to understand the factors associated with the process of migration in the field of migration studies. While Ravenstein (1889) observed that migrants move from areas of low opportunity to areas of high opportunity, Todaro (1969) showed that the discounted wage differential between the place of origin and place of destination motivates people to migrate. Scholars like Connell et al. (1976) argued from their village studies in India that land non-availability at the village level is the primary economic force driving emigration. In the words of Mukherji (2001), ‘The more an individual is poor, landless and socio-economically deprived, the greater the chance of his migration from rural to urban areas.’ Apart from that, the distance factor in the process of migration is a more contentious issue in the field of migration research. While scholars like Ravenstein (1889) and Zipf (1946) expressed the same view that the volume of migration tends to vary inversely with the distance, Stouffer (1940) questioned the generalisation that there is any necessary association between migration and distance. Instead, he argued that ‘the number of persons going a given distance is directly proportional to the number of opportunities at that distance and inversely proportional to the number of intervening opportunities’."

The present article focuses on one of its weakest links, the failure to generate sustainable livelihood opportunities, in either industry or agriculture. \n\nThe crisis in agriculture is best seen as part of a larger process of structural transformation of the Kerala economy which has blocked agrarian transition and requires thorough overhauling of the social organization of production for overcoming the present impasse. \n\nEven though local governments have a major role in resolving the agrarian question, it presupposes greater involvement of higher tiers of government and deeper cooperation among different tiers."

    "abstract": "(About the book) Through grass-roots studies, the volume traces how the last 20 years have seen a social and economic resurgence in South Asia – transiting from stages of poverty, low growth rates, illiteracy and poor health to flourishing economies, improved savings, greater investments and stronger human development indicators.\n\n(Chapter excerpt) Women empowerment is a broader concept including economic empowerment assessed by earning capacity, economic status and type of employment. Social empowerment is calculated by health, education and so on. Political empowerment is assessed by the percentage of women in parliament, percentage of women in legislature and so on. The crimes against women are also an indicator to assess the level of women empowerment. The word ‘empowerment’ is one, which is widely used but seldom defined. It is an active, multidimensional process which encompasses several multi-reinforcing components that begin with and are supported by economic independence. Empowerment literally means becoming powerful. In that perspective, the empowerment of women and the improvement of their status, particularly in respect of education, health and economic opportunities, are highly important. Women need to be empowered in order to become strong and ready to take up new challenges for building up of the family, society and the nation. According to Sushama Shay (1998), ‘Women Empowerment is a process which helps women to change other women’s consciousness through creating awareness’."

    "abstract": "Interrogating the cultural roots of contemporary Malayali middle classes, especially the upper caste Nambudiri community, The Fall of Gods is based on a decade-long ethnography and historico-sociological analyses of the interconnections between colonial history, family memories, and class mobility in twentieth-century south India. \n\nIt traces the transformation of normative structures of kinship networks as the community moves from colonial to neo-liberal modernity across generations. The author demonstrates how past family experiences of class and geographical mobility (or immobility) are retrieved and reshaped in the present as alternative ways of conceiving kinship, transforming the idea of collective suffering and sacrifice, and strengthening the felt necessity of territorial, caste, and religious mingling. \n\nRich in anthropological detail and incisive analyses, the book makes original contributions to the understanding of connection between gendered family relations and class mobility, and foregrounds the complex linkages between political history, memory, and the 'private' domain of kinship relations in the making of India’s middle classes. \n\nContents:\n\n    Introduction: Kinship, Memory, and Indian Middle Classes \n1. Some Moments in History \n2. From Gods to Human Beings: Mapping Generational Histories \n3. Debts of Identity: On Written Memories and Middle-Classness \n4. The Illam and Its Dispersion \n5.

    "abstract": "In this paper, the author traces two parallel movements of institutionalized Ayurvedic psychiatry, an emergent field of specialization in Kerala, India: the ‘work of purification’ and the ‘work of translation’ that Latour has described as characteristic of the ‘modern constitution.’ \n\nThe author delineates these processes in terms of the relationship of Ayurvedic psychiatry to (1) allopathic psychiatry, (2) bhutavidya, a branch of textual Ayurveda dealing with spirits, and (3) occult violence. \n\nThe aim is to offer a model of these open and hidden processes and of Ayurvedic psychiatry's positioning within a hierarchical mental health field characterized simultaneously by biopsychiatric hegemony and a persistent vernacular healing tradition. \n\nThrough these processes, Ayurvedic psychiatry emerges as a relevant actor. It demarcates itself from both allopathic and vernacular epistemologies and ontologies while simultaneously drawing upon aspects of each, and, in this way, shows itself to be both deeply modern and highly pragmatic."

    "abstract": "Despite the availability of a wide range of tools, measuring and explaining changes in land cover and land use in tropical regions can be extremely challenging. \n\nKerala is a biodiversity hotspot with a high population density and a long history of complex agricultural land-use patterns. \n\nSome reports suggest that agriculture in Kerala, which historically is rice paddy-wetland and agroforestry-based, is on the decline. However, the evidence is often anecdotal, especially with regards to smallholding homegarden agriculture. \n\nIn this study, the authors employ mixed methods, including remote sensing, quantitative household surveys, and semi-structured interviews, to unravel the complex land-cover and land-use changes occurring in Kerala.\n\nResults indicate that, from a land-cover change perspective, agroforests are in dynamic equilibrium with other land covers, being cleared for roads and new buildings, but offset by the expansion of younger, less diverse agroforests into paddy wetlands. \n\nYet beneath the canopy, agroforests are undergoing rapid land-use change not discernible using remote sensing. These changes include a reported decrease in the cultivation of 80% of Kerala’s primary crop species during 2003–2013, alongside a dramatic decline in chickens (from 12.5 to 2.6 per homestead on average) and cows (from 1.7 to 0.8). Over this period, no crop increased in cultivation. \n\nAccording to farmers, the primary drivers of this shift were declining profitability of agriculture in Kerala, labour shortages, unreliable weather, unfamiliar pests and diseases, and government policy.\n\nDespite the undeniable move away from agricultural activity in homegardens, the authors conclude that these ecologically and culturally important systems are not disappearing, but rather evolving to meet the needs of a less agricultural Kerala. \n\nThe research highlights the value of using mixed methods for characterizing land-use and land-cover histories in tropical regions."

    "abstract": "This article tries to analyse the trends in wealth inequality in Kerala from the early 1990’s. Historical evolution of inequality has followed a ‘U’ pattern in the state with high inequality in the pre-land reform period, decreased inequality in the period of public action and rising inequality post the 1990’s. The period of high growth in the state, facilitated by huge inflow of foreign remittances and the economic liberalization, was accompanied by a significant rise in wealth inequality in the state. The analysis shows that wealth inequality in Kerala stands very high and it has recorded a significant rise post the 1990’s with financialisation of land playing a central role in this transformation. It is a clear case of a ‘winner takes it all’ situation whereby the privileged class and caste groups in the society have pocketed a significant part of the incremental wealth in the state leaving no perceptible gain for the historically deprived groups."

The ‘result’ from the whole legal and judicial process may not give a solution to the ‘violence’ they have undergone, but the courtroom and client counselling experience reveals that it does provoke the woman to think in terms of emancipation.

    "abstract": "The Communist Party of India came to power in Kerala in 1957 during one of the tensest periods of the Cold War. Introducing landmark legislation on land, education, and administration, the initiatives of the Communist ministry in Kerala provoked vested interests to counter Soviet influence in the region, thus making India a theatre of the Cold War in South Asia. Efforts to counter the Communist ministry's political inroads in Kerala from within the country came to be known as the 'liberation struggle', which ultimately succeeded with the dismissal of the ministry. However, the ouster was part of a US-backed campaign for the containment of communism in Asia. This paper explores how US-based agencies overthrew the democratically-elected government in Kerala with the backing of Union Congress ministers and with the aid of the Indian Intelligence Bureau."

The most remarkable among them is the\n              Qiṣṣat Shakarwatī Farmāḍ\n              . This legend of community origins is here translated from the Arabic in full for the first time. Historians have dealt with such origin stories by transmitting them at face value, rejecting their historicity, or sifting them for kernels of historical truth. The comparative approach adopted here instead juxtaposes the\n              Qiṣṣa\n              with a Malayalam folksong and other Indian Ocean narratives of conversion as related in medieval Arabic travel literature to reveal underlying archetypes of just or enlightened kings as sponsors of community. The legend emerges as a crucial primary source for the constitution and self-definition of Islam in Kerala and for the discursive claims of this community vis-à-vis others."

We reported the age-adjusted incidence rate (AARi) and mortality rate (AARm) per 100,000 women and the proportion of thyroid cancers diagnosed in females per 100 cancer cases.\n\nDuring 2006, the AARi for thyroid cancer in women in Thiruvananthapuram was 6.9 per 100,000, rising to 10 in 2009 and 13.3 in 2012. There was a 93% increase in incidence rates over less than a decade. The AARis in the other four cities were stable. In 2012, Thiruvananthapuram had at least a fourfold higher incidence compared with other regions. Thyroid was the primary site in one of every 10 cancers diagnosed in Thiruvananthapuram, and large numbers of patients were <40 years of age. The AARm remained stable in all regions.\n\nWe reported a high burden of thyroid cancer in Kerala, which is most likely due to overdiagnosis."

Although the popularity of IB has increased among banking customers owing to the convenience it provides, there are several risks associated with its use since it relies heavily on the open access Internet network, which increases the chances of online fraud and phishing.\n\nThe specific objectives of the present study are (a) to develop and validate a scale for measuring the precautions taken by customers for the safe use of IB and (b) to examine the adequacy or otherwise of the precautions taken by IB users in Kerala, India. Through exploratory factor analysis, 16 items of precautions for the safe use of IB were reduced to six dimensions and were validated through confirmatory factor analysis.\n\nThe findings have managerial implications for banks, as they will help them take necessary steps to safeguard their customers against the risks associated with the use of IB. It is essential that IB service providers educate their customers regarding the required precautions for mitigating the risks.\n\nThe most important theoretical contribution of the study is the development and validation of a scale for measuring the precautions for safe use of IB."

International mobility is one strategy for middle class families to gain a positional advantage on a competitive labour market. Negotiating place attachment and global horizons may create a range of possibilities often attached to discourses of individualization and self-realization.\n\nThis paper analyses young people’s dispositions towards mobility in the transition from education to work by drawing on Bourdieu’s central concepts of symbolic capital and habitus.\n\nInterviews with students in higher secondary school in Thiruvananthapuram, covered broad themes like future expectations, skills and knowledge, everyday whereabouts and family life which were discussed in relation to a perceived activity space.\n\nI argue that young people’s future aspirations are shaped in a profound way by the history of Kerala’s in and out migration, and draw attention to differences within the middle class where transnational capital distinguishes rather than unifies ‘Indian youth’.\n\nFurthermore, this paper unpacks the complex, variegated images of different cities, countries and regions as symbols of cultural or economic capital in Malayali students’ expectations of their future education and employment."

While lack of recreation, being totally responsible, and insufficient income were associated with social stress, lack of recreation was associated with psychological stress.\n\nImpending death of the patient was a cause of mental stress among most caregivers irrespective of unmet needs.\n\nLack of initial technical training (99%) was not associated with stress since communication exists between caregivers and the palliative team including a doctor.\n\nDiscussion: Services to be aimed primarily at informal caregivers may be designed to increase the level of knowledge and emotional support of caregivers, provide relief from the unending burden of caring, or provide financial benefits to those who take on this responsibility."

    "abstract": "Why are some places in the world characterized by better social service provision and welfare outcomes than others? In a world in which millions of people, particularly in developing countries, continue to lead lives plagued by illiteracy and ill-health, understanding the conditions that promote social welfare is of critical importance to political scientists and policy makers alike. Drawing on a multi-method study, from the late nineteenth century to the present, of the stark variations in educational and health outcomes within a large, federal, multiethnic developing country - India - this book develops an argument for the power of collective identity as an impetus for state prioritization of social welfare. Such an argument not only marks an important break from the dominant negative perceptions of identity politics but also presents a novel theoretical framework to understand welfare provision"

    "abstract": "Muziris, which had attracted traders from the Mediterranean world for a very long span of time as the biggest supplier of spices, has now become one of the major historical sites that the archaeologists and historians of South Asia have been trying to geographically locate and identify. With the archaeological excavations at Pattanam, which brought to limelight particularly the material culture related to intense Roman commerce, there were frequent attempts to identify it with Muziris. However there are some historians, including M.G.S. Narayanan, who think that though the material objects from Pattanam are indicative of its strong trade relations with Rome, they are not sufficient enough to prove categorically that Pattanam was the actual site of Muziris. The recent scholarship on Muziris and the scholarly debates around it make maritime historians look at Muziris in the age of ‘early global trade’ by highlighting larger connections and locating its position in the trajectories of commodity movements within the Indian Ocean and outside, besides its physiological position in Kerala’s geography. This paper tries to look into the nuanced and changing character that Muziris acquired over the years by its participation in the larger network of commodity movements."

This region was the arena of the political activities of the Chera chiefs. Indigenous coinage and foreign currency found in their territory give at least a visibility of the monetary history of this region. Roman coins and coin hoards found in India have received due attention from numismatists, archaeologists and historians. It is the indigenous coinage which needs a reassessment in the light of the foreign coins and imported bullion available from the region. It is quite necessary here to understand the impact of Roman coins and other foreign coins on the indigenous issues and the economy of the region under discussion."

The first port that illuminates the maritime past of the Malabar coast is Muziris of the Classical texts. Figuring in the Tamil Sangam texts, the earliest known Tamil literary creations, as Muchiri, the port is sought to be identified (by many, but not unanimously) with the recently excavated coastal site of Pattanam in Kerala. While the land of the Cheras in ancient Kerala denoted the western fringe of what is called the Tamilakam of the Sangam literature, the eminence of the port of Muziris needs to be studied in the context of the Indian Ocean maritime scenario. This, in its turn, has a distinctbearing on the subcontinent’s commercial and cultural linkages with lands afar, especially West and Central Asia and the eastern Mediterranean region. This deliberately wide perspective may help focus better on the salience of Muziris as a port, along with the commonalities"

    "abstract": "Maritime dynamics is one of the key factors that have shaped the history of Kerala from the early times. Although maritime activities and interactions might have begun in the prehistoric times, no concrete evidence is available for the maritime contacts of Kerala till the early historic period, i.e. around the second half of the first millennium BCE. But, from the early historic period, copious evidence is available for the maritime activities and interactions of Kerala. During this period, long-distance trade and exchange activities that developed in the Indian Ocean region, due to the cultural efflorescence in far-off regions, led to active interactions among various cultures of the Indian Ocean rim and beyond. Kerala or Tamil country or India cannot be seen as ‘self-generating islands’—as the nationalist or regionalist perspectives would want us to believe-that contributed to the long-distance trade and exchange, rather they were part of the systems and processes happening in the regions covering parts of Asia, Europe and Africa (Indian Ocean Region). The reasons for the development of long-distance interactions in the early historic period include, the cultural developments in India and the regions around the Indian Ocean Rim and beyond, e.g. the rise of the Mauryan state and several other political formations, development of socio-economic complexities in ancient India and the emergence of the Roman empire and the related cultural dynamics. Several coastal towns and ports became important for the maritime interactions and the region of Tamizhagam (the\n\nstates of Kerala and Tamil Nadu) witnessed the growth of many ports near the river mouths. The study of ancient ports forms an important aspect of maritime historical and maritime archaeological investigations. In this paper, I present an overview of the evidence available for the ancient ports of Kerala. Only the major ancient ports of Kerala are discussed here, although there must have been many major and small ports of call on the Kerala coast."

Apart from archaeology, various other academic disciplines too had their beginnings during the colonial period. \n\nMany of these disciplines began working on the history and culture of India, since the colonial system felt that generation of knowledge about India could be useful in its project of subjugating India, although some of the individuals associated with the colonial system would have developed interest in the culture and history of India, simply out of curiosity. \n\nMost of the interpretations that are offered on the history of India have been based on the ideas of Aryans, Dravidians and civilizations that were developed during the colonial period. \n\nThe composition and transformation of population groups in India from the prehistoric to early historical period are very crucial for understanding the developments in Indian history and the processes involved in the development appear to be much more complex than what is conceived or imagined by historians, archaeologists, and historical linguists. \n\nThis paper argues that a major section of the populations of South India perhaps moved into this region from a much earlier period. It also highlights the need for decolonizing the practice of archaeology."

When the interest of the Marakkars was overlooked by the Portuguese in favour of the Portuguese settlers, the fomer turned against the latter.\n\nThough the Portuguese did not permit anybody else to deal in spices and other goods declared as monopoly items for three quarters of a century, they had to negotiate written contracts with the foreign merchant firms to bring cash and commodities to the Malabar Coast for direct purchases and for delivering the cargo at the India House in Lisbon against the stipulated price on the basis of these contracts. \n\nUnlike the English, the Dutch, the Danes, and the French, the Portuguese conducted their trade in the name of the king."

In their life, they give more prominence to career than marriage. It shows a rosy picture of the modern singlehood. Life satisfaction is a subjective assessment of the quality of one's life. So, an attempt is made here to analyse the life satisfaction level of single women on a ten-point scale. It includes three aspects -- general, social and personal life satisfaction The result proves that most single women are satisfied with their lives."

His return from ‘exile’ also represents a politico-economic reality of his ‘former subjects’ returning from their exiles abroad, especially from the Persian Gulf. While Mahabali can stage an annual return to Kerala, Maveli, the tribal chieftain whose land was usurped by the feudal lords in the tribal myths, cannot.\n\nThis article also investigates notions such as body, alienation of tribal land in contemporary Kerala, politics of myths and their ramifications on modern economic, political, philosophical and cultural affairs of the state and its deeply multicultural spaces."

He conceived of the temple as a social space where everybody could meet and exchange ideas.\n\nWhile pursuing his spiritual mission, he advocated education, industrialization, and abolition of caste as necessary prerequisites for social regeneration.\n\nThis work demonstrates that the SNDP was an organization of an emerging Ezhava middle class, which worked as both its strength and weakness. It focused on such issues as education, employment in government service, industrialization, abolition of cyclical rituals and caste, anti-alcoholism and the demand for a new law of inheritance.\n\nHowever, some disjunction between principles and practice led to the decline of the SNDP movement. Ironically, since the movement was largely focused on the interests of the privileged section of the Ezhava community, it achieved Ezhava solidarity only around caste.\n\nThis study is a significant example of how a social reform movement turned into a caste solidarity movement."

    "abstract": "The ancient port-town of Muziris was situated on the western coast of Kerala in present-day India. It was famed for its spice trade, notably the shipment of pepper and cinnamon, which were indigenous to the Malabar region. \n\nThe significance of this port town in the ancient spice route is evident in literary sources, from Pliny (Natural History) and Strabo (Geographica) to the Sangam epic works of Chithalai Chathanar (Silapadikaram) and Illango Adigal (Manimekalei). The Muziris economy depended on the spice trade. \n\nThe Sangam works describe the wars that were waged between Chera and the Pandyan kingdoms to win monopoly rights to the ancient spice routes. The Muziris-Vienna Papyrus, a second century AD parchment, speaks of the huge quantity of pepper that was traded from Muziris to Alexandria through Koptos and Berneike in a ship named Hermopollen. \n\nThe parchment also describes the taxes that were imposed on these commodities, and the well-organised merchant guilds based at Muziris.  This substantiates the claims of the Peutinger Tablet regarding Roman soldiers being stationed at Muziris to protect their commodities from pirates. \n\nLiterary sources are therefore invaluable to an understanding of the trans-oceanic trade of Muziris, which not only conveyed goods, religion, architecture and culture to and from the port, but also underpinned the state and economy of this particular place."

    "abstract": "Over the past several decades, global economic relations within the fisheries sector have intensified creating a “global fish-food economy”. Until recently, relatively little attention has been paid to the gendered spatial relations underlying this system and the differential way globalization shapes men and women fish workers’ livelihood options. \n\nThis paper integrates insights from feminist commodity chain analysis and livelihood analysis to analyze household-level economic data and gendered patterns of labor among three fisherfolk communities in Trivandrum District, Kerala, India.The objective is to investigate the diverse impacts of globalization within fisheries on women and men in local fishing communities. \n\nDifferent gender divisions of labor across the three communities studied inform very different livelihood strategies in response to economic transformations. Thus, globalization in the fisheries plays out differently for men and women in different fishing communities as a result of different configurations of gender, work, culture, identity, and economy and the different ways households and communities are connected to fish economies at different scales. \n\nIdentifying these differences offers a means by which we might broaden our theoretical understanding of the gendered nature of globalization in resource-based economies."

The results of this round of KMS were largely on expected lines as the state was preparing itself to deal with the prolonged aftershocks of the 2008 global financial crisis on migration.\n\nSurprisingly, variables by which migration is measured, such as the number of emigrants and remittances, shot up when compared with the values observed in the past. This survey gave a clear picture of the migration in Kerala, putting all speculations and doubts to rest.\n\nThe results of KMS 2011 revealed several signs of impending decline in emigration from the state. Why did the prediction of a decline not happen? The 2011 analysis would have missed out some factors that determine emigration trend. What are those missing factors? \n\nMoreover, remittances in 2014 were about 40 percent higher than that of 2011. The increase in emigration during the same period was only 5 percent. There should be factors other than emigration that determine the trend in remittances. What are those factors? \n\nThis book tries to find out those factors and examines the related trends of emigration from Kerala."

This association between fevers and medicine is as relevant today, as this in-depth study of fever care reveals.\n\nAcknowledging the central role of health institutions in creating and propagating notions about illness in society, the author examines fever care through a study of hospitals. Fever care implies those aspects related to provisioning and cost involved among public and private sector hospitals.\n\nThe study examines various discourses on fevers prevalent in the southern state of Kerala, which influence policy and programmatic dimensions of the state health services system. \n\nA second and more important dimension of this book is a critique of the culture of biomedical practice, informed by the social constructivist framework and approaches in the field of science studies.\n\nOverall, the book studies the processes by which physical symptoms like fever are treated as epidemics to be controlled, and are therefore brought within a biomedical system, thereby opening up options for commercialization of care."

    "abstract": "This study discusses women workers in an apparel park in a major urban centre in southern Kerala.\n\nContending the proposition that the expansionary nature of capital accompanied by the new economic and political reality univocally controls the economic responses by labour, irrespective of the constraints of locations and localities, the author argues for multiple ways in which globalizing processes may unravel over space.\n\nThe study reveals how local labour markets develop their own strategies to control labour, and reinforce gendered norms to exploit women workers. These tactics are achieved by means of involving agents in the local communities and local religious bodies in the region. Indigenous patriarchy along with global capitalism work hand in hand to control women's bodies and labour.\n\nThe overall book studies the intertwining of work with embedded patriarchal notions of women's place in designated spheres, and the overt and covert processes of resistances that women offer in defining new roles and old ones anew. While employment opportunities have opened up and are constantly expanding for women, the book interrogates whether their working status is breaking gender stereotypes or reaffirming them."

The first is the relative shortage of agricultural workers, and the second the comparatively high wage rate in agriculture. \n\nWe argue that the failure to mechanise agricultural operations cannot be explained without examining the larger question of the stunted development of agriculture in the State. \n\nA revival of agriculture, therefore, cannot be based entirely on mechanisation, for it must address a range of problems including the growing dominance of the “asset” function of land at the expense of its “means of production” function, and the atomisation of farming. \n\nThe social organisation of production needs to be reoriented such that the means of production function is reinstated and the limits imposed by the small size of farms are overcome. Possible remedies to this problem include collectivisation of agriculture, appropriate organisational structures for production, and State support."

I attempt to answer these questions by focusing on the Malabar region of Kerala, which was part of the Madras Presidency in British India."

Though Kerala has been described as the ‘Scandinavia of India’ for its public actions in favour of citizen rights, land reform, welfare policies and most recently decentralisation, the Left there has not been successful in also fostering interest representation beyond the dominance of parties or building a growth coalition so as to combine economic growth and social justice. \n\nThe Left has failed to reconcile – through practice, policy or social institutions – the interests of dynamic business, precarious middle classes and underprivileged labour. Kerala’s development has been dominated since the 1990s by the dynamics of globalization, economic liberalism and labour migration, and the full potential of high education levels has remained untapped. \n\nAchievements with regard to social justice are more the outcome of broad mobilisations in society than of leftist policies. In West Bengal, after initial improvements in rights and well-being brought by agrarian reform, the Left’s continued reliance on patronage networks and more recently, policies that favoured big companies and external investment, led to stagnation and electoral defeat."

    "abstract": "This paper examines how India’s national urban development agenda is reshaping relationships between national, State, and city-level governments. \n\nJawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission, the flagship programme that heralded a new era of urban investment in India, contained a range of key governance aspirations: linking the analysis of urban poverty to city-level planning, developing holistic housing solutions for the urban poor, and above all empowering Urban Local Bodies to re-balance relationships between State and city-level governments in favour of the latter. \n\nHere, we trace Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission’s implementation in Kerala’s capital city, Trivandrum (Thiruvananthapuram), where the city’s decentralised urban governance structure and use of ‘pro-poor’ institutions to implement housing upgrade programmes could have made it an exemplar of success. \n\nIn practice, Trivandrum’s ‘city visioning’ exercises and the housing projects it has undertaken have fallen short of Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission’s lofty goals. \n\nThe contradictions between empowering cities and retaining centralised control embedded within this national programme, and the unintended city-level consequences of striving for Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission funding success, have reshaped urban governance in ways not envisaged within the policy. \n\nAs a result, Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission has been important in rescaling governance relationships through three interlinked dynamics of problem framing, technologies of governance, and the scalar strategy of driving reform ‘from above’ that together have ensured the national state’s continued influence over the practices of urban governance in India."

    "abstract": "This paper scrutinizes some of our most enduring assumptions about the genre of autobiography. More particularly, it examines the predicative links, the transitivities, which bind notions of self-life-and-writing. \n\nIt comes to this exercise through a reading of Madhavikutty-Kamala Das’ <i>Balyakala Smaranakal</i> (Memories of a Childhood) (1987). This autobiography promises to trace the self from its incipience—only to side-step the self’s emergence and to hide this deferral in plain sight. \n\nThe paper argues that <i>Balyakala Smaranakal</i> (BS) uses our expectations of the genre and our presumptions about the writer—particularly her abiding preoccupation with self-production—as accomplices. It invites us to witness the textual densities which the child-protagonist gathers and then deploys these strategies to un-do the self’s emergence. By deferring the production of the self BS stages the autobiography as “intransitive”. This paper goes some way in examining the reasons why it becomes impossible for BS to produce a legible self; for the child-protagonist to step into the social category that it summons forth. It examines the formal as well as socio-historical conditions within which this autobiography becomes the place of self-postponement—rather than of self-presentation and self-actualization."

Studies in the developing world have shown how reduced capabilities have compromised the effective participation of marginalized communities in participatory development. \n\nExtending Sen’s capability approach through Foucault’s ideas on power and subject creation, by further literature review, I explore the possibilities of examining the origins of institutional neglect of marginalized communities in Kerala, India. Concepts of normalization and homogenization through the workings of traditional sources of power are put forward as a basis for these communities’ disenfranchisement. \n\nFrom here, I argue that a reassessment of the state’s decentralized development by reviewing cultural contexts surrounding public participation and by adopting a multilevel approach to understanding complex power arrangements, thereby going beyond an economic framing of development, are ways of ensuring effective democratic decentralization. These steps are imperative if development objectives are to be met and sustained."

Kalaripayattu is considered as the basis for all martial arts. This martial art has been practised on the basis of a scientific system of medicine called Kalarichikilsa (Kalari-related treatment). \n\nThis article investigates the potential of cultural heritage resources from a supply and demand perspective, as cultural resource management is the need of the hour to preserve and commercialise cultural and heritage resources. \n\nThe study reveals that cultural heritage resources like Kalaripayattu could become a unique selling proposition of Indian tourism market, provided these resources are protected, preserved, and encouraged through effective promotion strategies in various target markets."

    "abstract": "Roar is one of the few vocal expressions of the kathakali actor, and a roar is the vocal entry of an antihero, a villain or a demoness. Roar is highly significant in the history of women in kathakali because it established an intrinsic relationship with the performance career of the first-known woman kathakali performer, Kartyayani, in 1719. Roar is a recurrent point of reference in the conversations of female kathakali performers. The female kathakali will stride somewhere between tears and roars. Performers roar differently and therefore the roar of a woman will be a female roar, not a male roar. If the star \"roarer\", the late Kalamandalam Ramankutty Nair, roared remarkably differently to the late Keezhpadam Kumaran Nair, then a female \"roarer\" can also roar her own distinct female roar. Since kathakali has historically been patriarchal in approach, female kathakali performers appear to respond to the situation by appropriating the most theatrically male characteristic, such as the \"roar\", for themselves."

    "abstract": "In this chapter, the author offers an ethnographic study of nangiar kuthu, and in it she traces its evolution from an obscure temple-theatre genre to an important female genre in the current Indian theatre scene. \n\nContemporary nangiar kuthu, a solo female storytelling performance with a centuries-old heritage, compels one to watch. In nangiar kuthu, a sub-genre of kutiyattam, one actress tells the story of the god, Krishna, by blending a codified sign language system of the hands, face, and eyes with movement and mime. \n\nNangiar kuthu survived the breakdown of the socioeconomic arrangement that had underpinned its performance and moved to a new level. In 1984, a watershed event occurred. P.K. Narayanan Nambiar published an acting manual for nangiar kuthu. \n\nThe author attempts to bring together data that she collected on women who perform nangiar kuthu during more than thirty years of continuous fieldwork."

    "abstract": "There is one important trend in the electoral outcomes in Kerala over the past three decades: the incumbent party loses out unless extraordinary circumstances come into play. The results of the 2009 Lok Sabha election were exactly a reversal of the results of the 2004 elections – a complete swing from left to right. The victory of the UDF in the Lok Sabha election 2009 can be attributed to multiple factors: one is the anti-incumbency syndrome that Kerala experiences in election after election, another  is the high percentage of vote for the UDF among the minorities – the LDF lost nearly 15 percent of Muslim votes compared to the 2004 Lok Sabha elections. It is better to say that the future of bipolar coalition politics of Kerala heavily depends on the performance of the fronts as well as the attitude of minority communities which depends on the configuration of political parties at the national and state levels."

However, there was some evidence of small but significant shifts in labour relations.\n\nHigher wages, more opportunities for work, better implementation, and a greater recognition of the caregiving responsibilities of women will be required for this policy to fully meet its goals."

Kumar focuses on Kamala Das’s status as a bilingual writer who at the beginning of her career chose the English language for her poetic writing and Malayalam for her short stories. \n\nThe author suggests that a close consideration of the economies of expression in Das’s early poetry and short fiction permits us to explore her bilingual compositional method in relation to questions pertaining to the mother tongue, but also relating to location and translation. \n\nParadoxically, while Das’s poetry in English displays a directness and fluency usually associated with prose, her early prose fiction draws on arrangements of language forged in the neighbourhood of the poetic. \n\nThe essay aims at demonstrating how such a productive deployment of genre instability enables Das’s stories to fabricate an unusual perceptual apparatus which works by generating gaps between narration and description as well as between inner thoughts and external expressions of characters."

Many end up in the new service sector, getting jobs in high-end restaurants, shopping malls and spas. \n\nThe demand for their labour is due to their un-Indian 'exotic Asian' appearance and a reputation for being hardworking and loyal. Such labour market value is a remarkable reversal of their position considering the earlier colonial stereotypes of their savagery and disobedience, reproduced through the de-politicisation of their armed insurrections during the post-colonial period. \n\nThis paper addresses their daily experiences of vulnerability and marginality as well as the freedom and aspirations that a migratory life seem to engender.\n\nThis ethnographic essay is based on six months of fieldwork that Karlsson conducted in South India, mainly in Kerala, but also during visits to Bengaluru, Hyderabad and other major cities in the south, and on follow-up trips to Northeast India."

It examines skill as a social relation and non-payment of wages as an accumulation strategy. \n\nWages of local workers and that of migrant workers differ not only in terms of quantity, but also in terms of the processes and practices that surround them.

This article uses qualitative evidence to provide an important complementary perspective. \n\nUsing controlled comparisons of the princely state of Travancore with the neighbouring provinces of Malabar and Tirunelveli, I find that colonialism generated less social welfare because British officials empowered landlords. \n\nNotably, this occurred despite Malabar and Tirunelveli instituting ryotwari (cultivator-based) land tenure. British rule in India may have promoted landlordism irrespective of land tenure policy."

These plays of the 1920s and the 1930s emphasised the need for reforming the situation of women. Produced as a part of social renovation, they had a strong ideology that stood in favour of gender equity and initiated a cross-fertilisation of theatre, literature and social restructuring. \n\nThis paper locates the impact of drama in 20th-century Kerala on the portrayal of Namboodiri women and purports to analyse the deconstructing waves that lashed through the medium of theatre against the conventional norms of feminine subjugation. In this regard, the study explores the role of selected plays by V. T. Bhattathiripad, M. R. Bhattathiripad, Premji and Lalithambika Anterjanam as critical tools in the social reformation"

Data were collected from health workers (doctors, nurses, and PC nurses), government stakeholders (LSGI members and representatives of the National Health Mission), and the health workers and officials of NGO.\n\nThe program in two LSGIs varies considerably in terms of composition of the palliative team, infrastructure and human resource, cost, and type of service provided to the community. \n\nA comparative assessment with a non-governmental service provider shows that the services offered by the LSGIs seemed to be restricted in scope to meet the needs of the resource-stricken community.

One-year and lifetime prevalence of physical (75.5%, 78.5%), emotional (84.5%, 85.7%), and sexual (21.0%, 23.8%) abuse was high. \n\nMost abuse was reported as occurring ‘sometimes’ rather than ‘many times’. More males than females reported being victims of abuse; figures for one-year prevalence were: physical abuse (83.4% vs. 61.7%), emotional abuse (89.5% vs. 75.7%), and sexual abuse (29.5% vs. 6.2%). \n\nVarious factors significantly increase the likelihood of abuse—male gender, low socioeconomic status, regular use of alcohol and drugs by family member at home, and having other difficulties at school. \n\nChildren tended to report abuse less frequently if they liked attending school and if they always felt safe at school. \n\nThe results highlight the urgent need to address the issue of abuse in the school environment and minimize its impact."

Through the lens of Performance Studies, the book explores Kerala’s transformation into a neoliberal region.\n\nInfluenced by contemporary theories of ‘affect’, I highlight bodily sensory locations and actions, and embodiment in general, as important but neglected sites of enormous political significance. The first two chapters focus on two sensory locations central to the experience of any performance—vision and voice. The third emphasises gesture, while the last two chapters focus on two aspects that push at the boundaries of being-human—the machinic and the animal.\n\nBy closely analysing how these affects and embodiments are used in performances, I discuss the cultural politics of staging both the revolutionary and the terrorist during the Emergency of 1975–77 and after; the relationship between authoritarianism and democracy; and the emergence of a neoliberal consumption regime following widespread migration to the Gulf. In the process, the book analyses diverse performance forms, like theatre, cinema, kathaprasangam, mimics parade, and popular poetry recitals.\nTable of Contents\n\nAcknowledgements / Publisher’s Acknowledgements\nIntroduction\n1.

Yet the thriving public life of history in India is in inverse proportion to the dwindling interest in and development of academic history across India today. \n\nRecent debates and discussions about school textbooks allow us to return to the troubled relationship between these worlds of history writing, which will be critical to a meaningful response to the challenges faced by academic history in India over the years."

I demonstrate how a middle-class culture of education that articulates hegemonic experiences, aspirations, and trajectories drives many aspiring middle-class young men to consider migrating as an alternative path to social mobility.\n\nMigration emerges as a temporary strategy geared towards accruing economic and cultural capital necessary for the fulfilment of class-based personal ambitions and wider social responsibilities at home. Migration is shown to stretch the boundaries of processes of class formation that now straddles multiple sites, resources, and aspirations."

    "abstract": "In engaging with the debate on modernity, this article constructs the notion of a ‘subaltern modernity’ as a process of epistemological – spatial/temporal/agential – coalescence constituting a transverse solidarity politics.\n\nThis is empirically informed by the narratives of the livelihood-environmental resistance launched by subalterns in the Indian state of Kerala, known for its twin legacies – of communist government and social development – which have proved to be a direct challenge to the state/corporate-led developmentalism in the region.\n\nThe article thus attempts to contribute to the debate on modernity more from the perspective of resisting subjects and agents, with their particular subjective experience and understandings of science and reasoning. \n\nHowever, their resistance generates transformative events of universal relevance and thereby global issues of epistemology. As such, the article develops a theory of knowledge that takes subaltern resistance itself as modernity."

Estimation of financial literacy is a prerequisite for strategies to improve financial literacy. \n\nThis paper, using data collected from the educated young adults in Kerala, the most literate state in India, builds a predictive model for financial literacy employing logistic regression. \n\nThe study reveals the low level of financial literacy in the state. The model points to the significance of gender, age, religion, discipline of study, occupation, and personal income as determinants of financial literacy. \n\nThe findings have implications for policies aimed at improving the financial literacy of young adults in India."

    "abstract": "This paper explores how a marginalized community in North Kerala uses football and football fandom in order to create a vibrant space for active citizenry. We examine how the categories of football fan and citizen foster each other and provide alternatives to the imagination of a nation that in its discursive homogeneity fosters divisiveness. At the same time, this paper is also interested in the constitution of the football fan community as resolutely local and in dynamic, and negotiated relationship with state machinery. While literature on sports in India has been overwhelmingly centered on the themes of nation and nationalism, this ethnographic study attempts to critically look at the making of a regional identity, from the margins of a nation, through the region’s popular sport, football. In this paper, we explore the ways in which Nainamvalappu football fans Association, an organization based in the coastal region of Nainamvalappu in Kozhikode, converted an open place into a football ground overnight to resist the setting up of a slaughterhouse in the same place by the city corporation, as a form of active resistance but also place making. We argue that this football fans’ association allows for new understandings of popular sovereignty and democracy through a revitalization of sporting spaces."

    "abstract": "This article recommends a virtually unknown manuscript on the early Portuguese presence in India to wider scholarly attention. Dubbed here the Wye manuscript, this text purports to be an English translation of a sixteenth-century Malayalam history that was produced at the court of the ruler of Calicut. The South Indian kingdom of Calicut was central to Portugal’s project of monopolizing the region’s all-important pepper trade; the Wye manuscript therefore holds the promise of adding an Indian perspective to a history that has been written largely on the basis of European sources. This article examines the external and internal evidence for the author’s claim of having translated the text from an original palm-leaf manuscript held by members of Calicut’s royal family. An analysis of its content shows significant overlap with an Arabic history of the sixteenth century; a comparison of their similarities and differences suggests a number of insights into the processes of composition and revision of both the Malayalam and Arabic texts. Last, and most important, the Wye manuscript is transcribed in full in the hope of stimulating further discussion and study."

    "abstract": "The previous chapter used a statistical analysis to show that the differences in the behaviour of Indian state governments toward local democratic institutions can be explained in large part by the degree to which the state chief minister faces competition for control over the party's organisational networks. While the statistical analysis demonstrates correlations across cases, this chapter (Chapter 6) hones in on the workings of state governments in Kerala and Tamil Nadu to shed light on whether the within-case dynamics are consistent with the implications of the book's argument.\n\nChapter 6 studies the implementation of local democratization and devolution (or lack thereof) that took place under four different state governments – three successive state governments in Kerala that were in office between 1991 and 2001 and one state government in Tamil Nadu that was in office between 1991 and 1996. The chapter mainly relies on examining the dynamics of intraparty competition and local democratization within these cases. However, a comparison of the successive governments within the state of Kerala over time allows us to gain an understanding of how the process of local democratization and devolution unfolds over time. \n\nThe case of Tamil Nadu is a useful contrasting case and helps to show that how the book's theoretical argument can be used to explain the otherwise puzzling divergence in local government reform across the two states."

    "abstract": "This article calls for a re-evaluation of basic concepts such as caste and status groups for making sense of the social organisation of Muslims in Malabar. \n\nMuslim social groups, while disseminating notions of egalitarian claims of Islam, rationalise social divisions and discriminatory practices among themselves largely in terms of Islamic juristic concepts of purity, knowledge, piety and morality. \n\nDue to increasing Islamisation, these notions have been reconstructed to sustain social divisions among Muslims. Therefore, it is argued here that social divisions among Muslims in Malabar today do not derive primarily from acculturative influences of Hinduism. \n\nThe article concludes that since sociological concepts such as caste, ethnicity and status groups as used in South Asia have failed to capture this Islamic cultural mediation, these phenomena need to be further researched."

Cross-sectional data were utilised to address the study's aim, drawing on data collected from female sex workers in Calicut, Kerala, and Chirala, Andhra Pradesh. Use of mobile phone solicitation was reported by 46.3% (n = 255) of Kerala participants and 78.7% (n = 464) of those in Andhra Pradesh. Kerala participants reporting exclusive solicitation using mobile phones demonstrated 1.67 times higher odds (95% CI: 1.01–2.79) of inconsistent condom use than those reporting non-use of mobile phones for solicitation. However, those reporting exclusive solicitation through mobile phones in Andhra Pradesh reported lower odds of inconsistent condom use (OR: 0.03; 95% CI: 0.01–0.26) than those not using mobile phones for solicitation. Findings indicate that solicitation of clients using mobile phones facilitates or hampers consistency in condom use with clients depending on the context, and how mobile phones are incorporated into solicitation practices. Variations in sex work environments, including economic dependence on sex work or lack thereof may partially account for the different effects found."

The essence of conservation is traced through ecosophical meditations of Uexküll, Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, Deleuze and Guattari. We open up the thinking on conservation towards enhancement of ecology and propose minority politics which may de-singularise the ego-logical schizophrenia towards re-territorialisation of the eco-logical assemblage of human incorporeality."

    "abstract": "Because of the secularity of sociology, religion remains a relatively marginal field of study and the insights of the sociology of religion are generally ignored or overlooked within other subfields. But religion can be a force that deeply influences personal, community, and national life in nonobvious ways through shaping the social and political structures of society. Consequently, including an analysis of religion as a fundamental factor of social life could greatly enrich and even transform many subfields of sociology. In this essay, I focus on the sociology of migration and immigration, my area of research, and show how religion plays a central role in social, economic, and political processes surrounding migration. Drawing on case studies of migration and immigration of groups from India based on my research and that of others, I discuss how religion, through a variety of indirect and direct mechanisms, shapes migration patterns, remittance use, social incorporation into receiving societies, and forms of political mobilization."

Epidemiological investigations are ongoing and 27 histopathologically confirmed cases of CL have been reported from five settlements indicating transmission of disease within settlements. One of the priorities for control/prevention of CL is to create awareness among the community and ensure optimal utilization of interventions. First step in this direction would be to carry out a situation analysis on prevailing knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) of inhabitants. A study among 103 respondents from 10 Kani tribal settlements showed that though 39.8% of respondents recognized pictures of CL shown to them, but did not have any lay perceptions. There was absolutely no awareness on vector, transmission, risk factors and control measures. The role of sandflies in CL causation was not known to the residents and this prevented them from using any personal protection and adhering to control measures which in turn pose risk of spread of infection within settlements and to newer areas. CL has emerged as a challenging infection in this area and an urgent need for designing appropriate preventive measures and health education strategies is addressed in this article."

    "abstract": "Colonialism was much more than another instance of imperialism in human history. It introduced European categories and concepts into everyday habits and thoughts of the colonized. Focusing on writings of Vakkom Moulavi, who is known as the father of Islamic reform in Kerala, Abraham argues that the socio-religious reform movements of the colonial period were largely shaped by the discourse on modernity. In the wake of the socio-political changes initiated by colonial rule in Kerala, Vakkom Moulavi motivated Muslims to embrace modernity, especially modern education, in order to reap maximum benefit. In this process, to counter the opposition of conservative leaders and their followers, he initiated religious reform arguing that the major themes of colonial discourse were fully compatible with Islamic traditions. However, though modernization was the overall purpose of his socio-reform movement, he held fairly ambivalent attitudes towards individualism, materialism, and secularization and defended Islam against the attacks of Christian missionaries."

    "abstract": "The Basel Mission, a Swiss/German Protestant Christian missionary organization established in Basel, in Switzerland, started its work in India, in the districts of Malabar and South Canara of the erstwhile Madras Presidency from 1834. \n\nDuring the period ending with the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, the Mission initiated a number of economic activities which eventually culminated in the establishment of large modern industries in the lines of modern handloom weaving and tile manufacture. \n\nThese industries, established  to give employment to the converts who had lost their jobs as a consequence of their conversion to Christianity, were the first post-Industrial Revolution type factories in the Malabar and South Canara  districts and were comparable to the similar industrial undertakings in Europe during the period. \n\nThis book examines the Basel Mission industries in context of the  theological orientation of the Mission, the social, economic and colonial environment under which these industries functioned. The book also examines the trajectory of growth of tile and weaving industries in Malabar and South Canara districts in the lines demonstrated by the Basel Mission industries."

    "abstract": "Is there an alternative model to small family farming that could provide sustainable livelihoods to millions of resource-constrained and often non-viable smallholders in developing countries?\n\nCould group farming constitute such an alternative, wherein smallholders voluntarily pool land, labour and capital to create larger farms that they manage collectively?\n\nIn South Asia, for instance, over 85% of farmers are small and increasingly female. Potentially, group farming could provide them economies of scale, a dependable labour force, more investible funds and skills, and greater bargaining power with governments and markets.\n\nBut can this potential be realised in practice? In particular, can group farms economically outperform small family farms?\n\nA rare opportunity to test this is provided by two experiments begun in the 2000s in the Indian states of Kerala and Telangana.\n\nConstituted only of women, the groups lease in land to farm collectively, sharing labour, the cost of inputs, and the returns. But the states differ in several respects, including the technical support the groups receive, and their institutional base, composition, land access and cropping patterns.\n\nBased on the author's primary sample surveys in both states, this paper compares the productivity and profitability of group farms with that of small individual family farms in the same state.\n\nKerala’s groups perform strikingly better than the predominantly male-managed individual farms, both in their annual value of output per hectare and annual net returns per farm, while in Telangana group farms perform much worse than individual farms in annual output, but are equivalent in net returns.\n\nIn both states, groups do much better in commercial crops than in traditional foodgrains, where the largely male-managed individual farms, owning good quality land and with longer farm management experience, have an advantage.\n\nThe factors underlying the differential performances of Kerala and Telangana, and the lessons learnt for possible replication, are also discussed.\n\nOverall, the paper demonstrates that group farming can provide an effective alternative, subject to specified conditions and adaptation of the model to the local context."

    "abstract": "This article examines the travel writing of the well-known author from Kerala, S.K. Pottekkatt, who is now recognized as a national literary figure.\n\nRecent readings of his African travelogues have pointed to the deep racism that informs them. This article probes further, seeking to place Pottekkatt's ethnocentrism in the context of decolonization, which formed the backdrop of his travels and writing.\n\nI argue that Pottekkatt's ethnocentrism also contains a strand which is underpinned by nationalist biopolitics. While we find his writings deeply entrenched in racist colonial stereotypes about native Africans, they are also shaped by nationalist biopolitics that were emerging during decolonization, which led him to strongly condemn prominent groups of Indian immigrants in Africa as well.\n\nDipesh Chakrabarty's reflections on the ambiguities of decolonizing discourses provide a useful springboard for a fresh reading. This preliminary reading of Pottekkatt's African travelogues, however, complicates Chakrabarty's observations about both pedagogic and dialogic modes of decolonizing discourses.\n\nIt also points to the importance of the regional, and not the national, in the possibilities of South-South dialogue—to which Pottekkatt's accounts point, if only in a cursory manner."

The authors here examine the growth trends in Kerala’s urban population, the tempo and degree of concentration and capture the changes in development indicators based on data available from the Census of India.\n\nThe recent upsurge of 92.8 per cent urban growth rate in Kerala is due to the areal reclassification. The higher order towns (Classes I and II) in Kerala show a decline in growth of population, whereas the lower order towns (Class III towns) are growing.\n\nThe urban density decreased and work participation rate increased slightly during 2001–2011. This phase of urbanization is characterized by the growth of a more dispersed population than concentrated urban centres. The steady increase in the rate of urbanization in Kerala, however, is accompanied by low pace of development, especially of basic amenities, which is a matter of concern that needs policy attention."

In the sixteenth century, in the wake of the expansion of Portuguese imperial ambitions, the ulema conceived of the importance of building Islamic communities of multiple resistances around shafiite texts and discourses. \n\nIt looks at the complex scribal and hortatory engagements of the Malabar ulema and examines three major forms of resistance—pietistic, jurisprudential and physical—that they produced in the larger Indian Ocean region. \n\nTherefore, this article moves beyond the existing historiography that focuses on jihad (armed resistance) narratives, and demonstrates alternative ways of reading the period—which included the multiple ways in which the ulema constructed a consistent consciousness of resistance against the Portuguese. \n\nArguments in the article are located within the concepts of fasad (social and political disorder) and fitna (collapse of internal cohesion)—two major Islamic social and political categories. They, I show, attained very specific scribal and theological significance in the Indian Ocean textual network in the sixteenth century, and also acquired particular kinds of textual idioms."

Thematic analysis strategy was used for data analysis. \n\nThe findings reveal that the structural-, familial- and personal-level factors considerably shape social interactional milieu within schools through complex interactions of its triadic actors such as teachers, tribal students and non-tribal students. \n\nThe triadic interactions are characterized by social relations salience, namely, friendships, support, integration, conflicts, disconnections, distance, sense of otherness, rejections and dominance. These social relationships salience lead to identity threat perceptions, identification of self with others, and consolidating self and social images consistent with one’s own ethnic group. \n\nThis invokes two potential coping responses, namely, personal meaning making and avoiding distress and anxiety. This avoidance coping relates with increased school abstinence and dropouts, whereas personal meaning making relates with consolidation of ethnic identity in tribal children."

Employing the social exchange perspective and drawing on in-depth interviews of left-behind caregivers to older adults in emigrant households, we explore reciprocal motives, expectations and perceptions of burden. \n\nFindings resonate gendered expectations of care and social sanction that ensure women do much of the caregiving. Daughters-in-law sacrificed careers and endured separation from husbands to transition into caregiving roles, costs borne to effectuate their husband's filial role. \n\nPerceived non-reciprocity, unbalanced exchanges and unmet expectations increased perceptions of burden for caregivers. Temporary financial autonomy could hardly alleviate perceptions of burden among women caregivers who perceived emotional and functional support exchanges from husbands, older adults themselves or other family members as supportive."

    "abstract": "Globally known as Amma, meaning 'Mother', Mata Amritanandamayi has developed a massive transnational humanitarian organisation based in hugs. She is familiar to millions as the 'hugging saint', a moniker that derives from her elaborate darshan programmes wherein nearly every day ten thousand people are embraced by the guru one at a time, events that routinely last ten to twenty hours without any rest for her. Although she was born in 1953 as a low-caste girl in a South Indian fishing village, today millions revere her as guru and goddess, a living embodiment of the divine on earth.\n\n<i>Reflections of Amma</i> focuses on communities of Amma’s devotees in the United States, showing how they endeavour to mirror their guru’s behaviours and transform themselves to emulate the ethos of the movement. This study argues that 'inheritors' and 'adopters' of Hindu traditions differently interpret Hindu goddesses, Amma, and her relation to feminism and women’s empowerment because of their inherited religious, cultural, and political dispositions. In this insightful ethnographic analysis, Amanda J. Lucia discovers how the politics of American multiculturalism reifies these cultural differences in 'de facto congregations', despite the fact that Amma’s embrace attempts to erase communal boundaries in favour of global unity."

    "abstract": "This paper argues that in the study of matriliny in Kerala, insufficient attention has been paid to the post-marriage residence norm of virilocality in which a woman goes to reside in her husband's house after marriage. This has led to considerable romanticization of what matriliny meant for women in everyday life. In focusing on a caste called the Thiyyas, who have a history of matrilineal descent and inheritance, the paper explores the way the norm of virilocality is coupled with the idea of the ‘providing husband.’ I consider the idea of the ‘providing’ husband as both central to the image of a normative conjugality among the Thiyyas and also as an idea that has characterized legislative changes in matriliny and marriage since the late nineteenth century. Further, I argue that the idea of the ‘providing husband’ and post-marriage virilocal residence are coupled not only with a strong sense of a dependent wife but a husband's unequivocal authority. However, what marks out this context is that women inherit property and have a right to return to their natal homes. These practices in turn enable considerable flexibility in residence in everyday life."

    "abstract": "Recent debates on migration and development point out that labour migration can be a key driver of economic and human development and thereby social change (Goldin et al. 2011). The question of how international migrants can contribute to the development of their home countries is highly relevant to Kerala in South India, where remittances contribute about 28 per cent of the state domestic product (Kurien 2002). Undoubtedly, the remittances sent home by migrant workers are important, but how is migration reshaping the everyday lives of their families? Here I will look into women's and men's return migration from the Persian Gulf to Kerala and explore the effects on work and gender relations within their households. I will analyse this by focusing on how the migrants' return home affects women's agency. How does men's return migration have an impact upon women's control of their own lives? And how does women's return migration affect their agency?\n\nFor more than a decade several surveys on migration from Kerala to the Gulf have been conducted by researchers at the Centre for Development Studies in Thiruvananthapuram (Zachariah and Rajan 2012). Most of these surveys have focused on economic aspects of migration. However, recently, the India Migration Reports have contained articles on the social aspects of migration in Kerala. These include, for example, Rajan and Nair's (2013) work on children ‘left behind’, and Zachariah and Rajan's (2013) study of the impacts of migration on the elderly."

    "abstract": "In this chapter, I will explore the interrelationship between gender and Kerala's increasing consumption of household appliances, beauty products, convenience foods and clothing. I will examine gender ideals and negotiations in the home and family, as well as the powerful notion, emphasized both in women's reform movements from the early twentieth century and in product marketing of the past couple of decades, that consumption of household appliances is synonymous with women's liberation. This analysis of the interplay between gender and consumption draws on ethnographic research conducted by the author in Kerala from 2001 to 2004, as well as a review of more recent literature from Kerala.\n\nThis analysis should be of interest to two audiences: first, those who are engaged in gender studies in Kerala and in the gap between the many positive indicators of women's well-being and gender equality on the one hand, and the realities of power and task distribution in home and family on the other; second, researchers interested in theorizing the transformation of consumption in rapidly growing economies such as those of India, China and Brazil. My argument is that the nature and direction of these transformations cannot be fully grasped without a gender perspective that is grounded in place; in other words, a full understanding of changing consumption will not be possible without a lens that encompasses not only the extending web of global capitalism, but also the sociocultural drivers of bottom-up demand."

While discussing educational progress, it provides emphasis on agrarian migration to Malabar in the second half of twentieth century for its role in the general and higher education development of the region. \n\nThis study will be a timely and valuable reference material for researchers, educationists, educational planners, and administrators in India. The experience of Malabar is a pointer to the fact that educational progress can be achieved by the combined effort of government and private agencies with active public involvement."

Legal battles over provisions in the Indian Penal Code which criminalizes any sexual act \"against the order of nature\" are rife. \n\nEven though Kerala has been hailed as a paradox inside India (mainly due to its human development parameters), the social, cultural and legal environment in the state is hostile to individuals who question hetero-normativity. Non-judgemental and unbiased scientific therapy or counselling are seldom available to sexual minorities. \n\nThis paper is an attempt to map the experiences of a female who is openly bisexual, and is living in Kerala. An ethnographic interview was conducted where the experiences of the participant are explored, from the relationship dynamics as seen by her, to sexual experiences and difficulties in relationships. \n\nA reference is also made to the personal and social support systems that are in place for the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender (LGBT) community in Kerala and their role in initiating discourses regarding the topic. A few pointers for future studies in the topic, especially within the context of Kerala are also put forward."

Kerala, a state in southern India, advertises 'Kerala Ayurveda' as one of its particular attractions. \n\nThe objective of this paper is to study and understand the public health view on movements for healthcare and/or wellness across borders with a particular focus on the quality of treatments offered and on issues of ethics that concern patients from across different countries, but also the providers of Ayurveda treatments. \n\nTo gain insights into local perspectives, interviews were conducted with Ayurveda practitioners at Ayurveda resorts in Kerala, in particular in Kovalam and Varkala, both in Thiruvananthapuram district. \n\nThe analysis of our interviews shows that – perhaps not surprisingly in a world characterised by global capitalism – marketing plays an important role in attracting clients to resorts. Market considerations led to a transformation of how Ayurveda is presented to potential customers. \n\nThis in turn has undermined the significance of Ayurveda within the tourism industry of Kerala. Arguably, representatives of the state view this as an opportunity rather than considering the importance of further developing Ayurveda as a medical practice."

Kerala’s big plantations quietly and frequently engage in land grabbing which is similar to the land grabbing happening in Latin American and African continents.\n\nThe third aspect covered in this article is all about the changing class–caste nexus in Kerala’s occupational structure. Caste is no longer a major determining factor of occupations as was the case in the pre-land reform era. Land reforms could significantly break the traditional caste–class nexus."
